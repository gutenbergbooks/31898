<h2>THE BRIGHT SHAWL</h2>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>When Howard Gage had gone, his
mother&#8217;s brother sat with his head
bowed in frowning thought. The
frown, however, was one of perplexity rather
than disapproval: he was wholly unable to comprehend
the younger man&#8217;s attitude toward his
experiences in the late war. The truth was,
Charles Abbott acknowledged, that he understood
nothing, nothing at all, about the present
young. Indeed, if it hadn&#8217;t been for the thoroughly
absurd, the witless, things they constantly
did, dispensing with their actual years he would
have considered them the present aged. They
were so&mdash;well, so gloomy.</p>
<p>Yet, in view of the gaiety of the current parties,
the amounts of gin consumed, it wasn&#8217;t precisely
gloom that enveloped them. Charles Abbott
searched his mind for a definition, for light
on a subject dark to a degree beyond any mere
figure of speech. Yes, darkness particularly
described Howard. The satirical bitterness of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
his references to the &#8220;glorious victory in France&#8221;
was actually a little unbalanced. The impression
Abbott had received was of bestiality choked
in mud. His nephew was amazingly clear,
vivid and logical, in his memories and opinions;
they couldn&#8217;t, as he stated them in a kind of
frozen fury, be easily controverted.</p>
<p>What, above everything else, appeared to dominate
Howard Gage was a passion for reality, for
truth&mdash;all the unequivocal facts&mdash;in opposition
to a conventional or idealized statement. Particularly,
he regarded the slightest sentiment
with a suspicion that reached hatred. Abbott&#8217;s
thoughts centered about the word idealized;
there, he told himself, a ray of perception might
be cast into Howard&#8217;s obscurity; since the most
evident fact of all was that he cherished no ideals,
no sustaining vision of an ultimate dignity behind
men&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>The boy, for example, was without patriotism;
or, at least, he hadn&#8217;t a trace of the emotional
loyalty that had fired the youth of Abbott&#8217;s day.
There was nothing sacrificial in Howard Gage&#8217;s
conception of life and duty, no allegiance outside
his immediate need. Selfish, Charles Abbott decided.
What upset him was the other&#8217;s coldness:
damn it, a young man had no business to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
be so literal! Youth was a time for generous
transforming passions, for heroics. The qualities
of absolute justice and consistency should
come only with increasing age&mdash;the inconsiderable
compensations for the other ability to be
rapt in uncritical enthusiasms.</p>
<p>Charles Abbott sighed and raised his head.
He was sitting in the formal narrow reception
room of his city house. The street outside was
narrow, too; it ran for only a square, an old
thoroughfare with old brick houses, once no more
than a service alley for the larger dwellings back
of which it ran. Now, perfectly retaining its
quietude, it had acquired a new dignity of residence:
because of its favorable, its exclusive,
situation, it was occupied by young married
people of highly desirable connections. Abbott,
well past sixty and single, was the only person
there of his age and condition.</p>
<p>October was advanced and, though it was
hardly past four in the afternoon, the golden
sunlight falling the length of the street was already
darkling with the faded day. A warm
glow enveloped the brick façades and the window
panes of aged, faintly iridescent glass; there was
a remote sound of automobile horns, the illusive
murmur of a city never, at its loudest, loud; and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
through the walls, the notes of a piano, charming
and melancholy.</p>
<p>After a little he could distinguish the air&mdash;it
was Liszt&#8217;s Spanish Rhapsody. The accent of
its measure, the jota, was at once perceptible and
immaterial; and overwhelmingly, through its
magic of suggestion, a blinding vision of his own
youth&mdash;so different from Howard&#8217;s&mdash;swept over
Charles Abbott. It was exactly as though, again
twenty-three, he were standing in the incandescent
sunlight of Havana; in, to be precise, the
Parque Isabel. This happened so suddenly, so
surprisingly, that it oppressed his heart; he
breathed with a sharpness which resembled a
gasp; the actuality around him was blurred as
though his eyes were slightly dazzled.</p>
<p>The playing continued intermittently, while
its power to stir him grew in an overwhelming
volume. He had had no idea that he was still
capable of such profound feeling, such emotion
spun, apparently, from the tunes only potent
with the young. He was confused&mdash;even, alone,
embarrassed&mdash;at the tightness of his throat, and
made a decided effort to regain a reasonable
mind. He turned again to the consideration
of Howard Gage, of his lack of ideals; and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
still in the flood of the re-created past, he saw,
in the difference between Howard and the boy
in Havana, what, for himself anyhow, was the
trouble with the present.</p>
<p>Yes, his premonition had been right&mdash;the
youth of today were without the high and romantic
causes the service of which had so
brightly colored his own early years. Not
patriotism alone but love had suffered; and
friendship, he was certain, had all but disappeared;
such friendship as had bound him to
Andrés Escobar. Andrés! Charles Abbott hadn&#8217;t
thought of him consciously for months. Now,
with the refrain of the piano, the jota, running
through his thoughts, Andrés was as real as he
had been forty years ago.</p>
<p>It was forty years almost to the month since
they had gone to the public ball, the danzón, in
the Tacon Theatre. That, however, was at the
close of the period which had recurred to him
like a flare in the dusk of the past. After the
danzón the blaze of his sheer fervency had been
reduced, cooled, to maturity. But not, even in
the peculiarly brutal circumstances of his transition,
sharply; only now Charles Abbott definitely
realized that he had left in Cuba, lost there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
the illusions which were synonymous with his
young intensity.</p>
<p>After that nothing much had absorbed him,
very little had happened. In comparison with
the spectacular brilliancy of his beginning, the
remainder of life had seemed level if not actually
drab. Certainly the land to which he had returned
was dull against the vivid south, the
tropics. But he couldn&#8217;t go back to Havana,
he had felt, even after the Spanish Government
was expelled, any more than he could find in the
Plaza de Armas his own earlier self. The whole
desirable affair had been one&mdash;the figures of
his loves and detestations, the paseos and
glorietas and parques of the city, now, he had
heard, so changed, formed a unity destroyed by
the missing of any single element.</p>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t, though, specially considering himself,
but rather the sustaining beliefs that so
clearly marked the divergence between Howard&#8217;s
day and his own. This discovery, he felt, was
of deep importance, it explained so much that
was apparently inexplicable. Charles Abbott
asserted silently, dogmatically, that a failure of
spirit had occurred ... there was no longer such
supreme honor as Andrés Escobar&#8217;s. The dance
measure in the Spanish Rhapsody grew louder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
and more insistent, and through it he heard the
castanets of La Clavel, he saw the superb flame
of her body in the brutal magnificence of the
fringed mantón like Andalusia incarnate.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>He had a vision of the shawl itself, and, once
more, seemed to feel the smooth dragging heaviness
of its embroidery. The burning square of
its colors unfolded before him, the incredible magentas,
the night blues and oranges and emerald
and vermilion, worked into broad peonies and
roses wreathed in leaves. And suddenly he felt
again that, not only prefiguring Spain, it was
symbolical of the youth, the time, that had gone.
Thus the past appeared to him, wrapped bright
and precious in the shawl of memory.</p>
<p>No woman that Howard Gage might dream of
could have worn La Clavel&#8217;s mantón; it would
have consumed her like a breath of fire, leaving
a white ash hardly more than distinguishable
from the present living actuality. Women cast
up a prodigious amount of smoke now, a most
noisy crackling, but Charles Abbott doubted the
blaze within them. Water had been thrown on
it. Their grace, too, the dancing about which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
they made such a stir,&mdash;not to compare it with La
Clavel&#8217;s but with no better than Pilar&#8217;s&mdash;was
hardly more than a rapid clumsy posturing.
Where was the young man now who could dance
for two hours without stopping on a spot scarcely
bigger than the rim of his silk hat?</p>
<p>Where, indeed, was the silk hat!</p>
<p>Even men&#8217;s clothes had suffered in the common
decline: black satin and gold, nicely cut
trousers, the propriety of pumps, had all vanished.
Charles Abbott recalled distinctly the
care with which he had assembled the clothing
to be taken to Cuba, the formal dress of evening,
with a plum-colored cape, and informal linens
for the tropical days. The shirt-maker had
filled his box with the finest procurable cambrics
and tallest stocks. Trivialities, yet they indicated
what had once been breeding; but now,
incredibly, that was regarded as trivial.</p>
<p>The Spanish Rhapsody had ceased, and the
sun was all but withdrawn from the street;
twilight was gathering, particularly in Charles
Abbott&#8217;s reception room. The gilded eagle of
the old American clock on the over-mantel seemed
almost to flutter its carved wings, the fragile rose
mahogany spinet held what light there was, but
the pair of small brocaded sofas had lost their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
severe definition. Charles Abbott&#8217;s emotion, as
well, subsided, its place taken by a concentrated
effort to put together the details of a scene which
had assumed, in his perplexity about Howard, a
present significance.</p>
<p>He heard, with a momentarily diverted attention,
the closing of the front door beyond,
women&#8217;s voices on the pavement and the changing
gears of a motor: Mrs. Vauxn and her
daughter were going out early for dinner.
They lived together&mdash;the girl had married into
the navy&mdash;and it was the former who played the
piano. The street, after their departure, was
silent again. How different it was from the
clamorous gaiety of Havana.</p>
<p>Not actual sickness, Charles Abbott proceeded,
but the delicacy of his lungs, following scarlet
fever, had taken him south. A banking associate
of his father&#8217;s, recommending Cuba, had,
at the same time, pointedly qualified his suggestion;
and this secondary consideration had determined
Charles on Havana. The banker had
added that Cuba was the most healthful place
he knew for anyone with no political attachments.
There political activity, more than an indiscretion,
was fatal. What did he mean?
Charles Abbott had asked; and the other had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
replied with a single ominous word, Spain.</p>
<p>There was, it was brought out, a growing
and potent, but secretive, spirit of rebellion
against the Government, to which Seville was
retaliating with the utmost open violence. This
was spread not so much through the people, the
country, at large, as it was concentrated in the
cities, in Santiago de Cuba and Havana; and
there it was practically limited to the younger
members of aristocratic families. Every week
boys&mdash;they were no more for all their sounding
pronunciamientos&mdash;were being murdered in the
fosses of Cabañas fortress. Women of the greatest
delicacy, suspected of sympathy with nationalistic
ideals, were thrown into the filthy pens of
town prostitutes. Everywhere a limitless system
of espionage was combating the gathering
of circles, tertulias, for the planning of a
Cuba liberated from a bloody and intolerable
tyranny.</p>
<p>Were these men, Charles pressed his query,
really as young as himself? Younger, some of
them, by five and six years. And they were shot
by a file of soldiers&#8217; muskets? Eight students
at the university had been executed at
once for a disproved charge that they had
scrawled an insulting phrase on the glass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
door of the tomb of a Cuban Volunteer. At
this the elder Abbott had looked so dubious that
Charles hastily abandoned his questioning.
Enough of that sort of thing had been shown; already
his mother was unalterably opposed to
Cuba; and there he intended at any price to go.
But those tragedies and reprisals, the champion
of his determination insisted, were limited, as he
had begun by saying, to the politically involved.
No more engaging or safer city than Havana existed
for the delight of young travelling Americans
with an equal amount of money and good
sense. He had proceeded to indicate the temperate
pleasures of Havana; but, then, Charles Abbott
had no ear for sensuous enjoyment. His
mind was filled by the other vision of heroic
youth dying for the ideal of liberty.</p>
<p>He had never before given Cuba, under Spanish
rule, a thought; but at a chance sentence it
dominated him completely; all his being had
been tinder for the spark of its romantic
spirit. This, naturally, he had carefully concealed
from his parents, for, during the days that
immediately followed, Cuba as a possibility was
continuously argued. Soon his father, basing
his decision on Charles&#8217; gravity of character,
was in favor of the change; and in the end his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
mother, at whose prescience he wondered, was
overborne.</p>
<p>Well, he was for Havana! His cabin on the
Morro Castle was secured, that notable trunkful
of personal effects packed; and his father, greatly
to Charles&#8217; surprise, outside all women&#8217;s knowledge,
gave him a small derringer with a handle
of mother-of-pearl. He was, now, the elder told
him, almost a man; and, while it was inconceivable
that he would have a use for the pistol, he
must accustom himself to such responsibility.
He wouldn&#8217;t need it; but if he did, there, with its
greased cartridges in their short ugly chambers,
it was. &#8220;Never shoot in a passion,&#8221; the excellent
advice went on; &#8220;only a cool hand is steady,
and remember that it hasn&#8217;t much range.&#8221; It
was for desperate necessity at a very short distance.</p>
<p>With the derringer lying newly in his grasp, his
eyes steadily on his father&#8217;s slightly anxious gaze,
Charles asseverated that he would faithfully attend
every instruction. At the identical moment
of this commitment he pictured himself firing
into the braided tunic of a beastly Spanish officer
and supporting a youthful Cuban patriot,
dying pallidly of wounds, in his free arm. The
Morro Castle hadn&#8217;t left its New York dock before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
he had determined just what part he would
take in the liberation of Cuba&mdash;he&#8217;d lead a hopeless
demonstration in the center of Havana, at
the hour when the city was its brightest and the
band playing most gaily; his voice, sharp like a
shot, so soon to be stilled in death, would stop
the insolence of music.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>This was not a tableau of self-glorification or
irresponsible youth, he proceeded; it was more
significant than a spirit of adventure. His determination
rested on the abstraction of liberty
for an oppressed people; he saw Cuba as a place
which, after great travail, would become the haunt
of perfect peace. That, Charles felt, was not
only a possibility but inevitable; he saw the forces
of life drawn up in such a manner&mdash;the good on
one side facing the bad on the other. There was
no mingling of the ranks, no grey; simply, conveniently,
black and white. And, in the end, the
white would completely triumph; it would be
victorious for the reason that heaven must reign
over hell. God was supreme.</p>
<p>Charles wasn&#8217;t at all religious, he came of a
blood which delegated to its women the rites and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
responsibilities of the church; but there was no
question in his mind, no doubt, of the Protestant
theological map; augustness lay concretely
behind the sky; hell was no mere medi&#230;val fantasy.
He might ignore this in daily practice, yet
it held him within its potent if invisible barriers.
Charles Abbott believed it. The supremacy of
God, suspended above the wickedness of Spain,
would descend and crush it.</p>
<p>Ranged, therefore, squarely on the side of the
angels, mentally he swept forward in confidence,
sustained by the glitter of their invincible pinions.
The spending of his life, he thought, was a
necessary part of the consummation; somehow
without that his vision lost radiance. A great
price would be required, but the result&mdash;eternal
happiness on that island to which he was taking
linen suits in winter! Charles had a subconscious
conception of the heroic doctrine of the destruction
of the body for the soul&#8217;s salvation.</p>
<p>The Morro Castle, entering a wind like the
slashing of a stupendous dull grey sword, slowly
and uncomfortably steamed along her course.
Most of the passengers at once were seasick, and
either retired or collapsed in a leaden row under
the lee of the deck cabins. But this indisposition
didn&#8217;t touch Charles, and it pleased his sense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
of dignity. He appeared, erect and capable, at
breakfast, and through the morning promenaded
the unsteady deck. He attended the gambling
in the smoking saloon, and listened gravely
to the fragmentary hymns attempted on Sunday.</p>
<p>These human activities were all definitely outside
him; charged with a higher purpose, he
watched them comprehendingly, his lips bearing
the shadow of a saddened smile; essentially he
was alone, isolated. Or at least he was at the
beginning of the four days&#8217; journey&mdash;he kept colliding
with the rotund figure of a man wrapped
to the eyes in a heavy cloak until, finally, from
progressing in opposite directions, they fell
into step together. To Charles&#8217; delight, the
other was a Cuban, Domingo Escobar, who lived
in Havana, on the Prado.</p>
<p>Charles Abbott learned this from the flourishing
card given in return for his own. Escobar
he found to be a man with a pleasant and considerate
disposition; indeed, he maintained a scrupulous
courtesy toward Charles far transcending
any he would have had, from a man so much
older, at home. Domingo Escobar, it developed,
had a grown son, Vincente, twenty-eight years
old; a boy perhaps Charles&#8217; own age&mdash;no, Andrés
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
would be two, three, years younger; and Narcisa.
The latter, his daughter, Escobar, unashamed,
described as a budding white rose.</p>
<p>Charles wasn&#8217;t interested in that, his thoughts
were definitely turned from girls, however flower-like;
but he was engaged by Vincente and Andrés.
He asked a great many questions about
them, all tending to discover, if possible, the activity
of their patriotism. This, though, was a
subject which Domingo Escobar resolutely ignored.</p>
<p>Once, when Charles put a direct query with
relation to Spain in Cuba, the older man,
abruptly replying at a tangent, ignored his question.
It would be necessary to ask Andrés
Escobar himself. That he would have an opportunity
to do this was assured, for Andrés&#8217;
parent, who knew the Abbotts&#8217; banking friend
intimately, had told Charles with flattering sincerity
how welcome he would be at the Escobar
dwelling on the Prado.</p>
<p>The Prado, it began to be clear, of all the
possible places of residence in Havana, was the
best; the Escobars went to Paris when they
willed; and, altogether, Charles told himself, he
had made a very fortunate beginning. He
picked up, from various sources on the steamer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
useful tags of knowledge about his destination:</p>
<p>The Inglaterra, to which he had been directed,
was a capital hotel, but outside the walls. Still,
the Calle del Prado, the Paseo there, were quite
gay; and before them was the sweep of the
Parque Isabel, where the band played. At the
Hotel St. Louis, next door, many of the Spanish
officers had their rooms, but at the hour of dinner
they gathered in the Café Dominica. The
Noble Havana was celebrated for its camarones&mdash;shrimps,
Charles learned&mdash;and the Tuileries,
at the juncture of Consulado and San Rafael
Streets, had a salon upstairs especially for
women. Most of his dinners, however, he would
get at the Restaurant Français, excellently kept
by François Garçon on Cuba Street, number
seventy-two.</p>
<p>There he would encounter the majority of
his young fellow countrymen in Havana; the
Café El Louvre would serve for sherbets after
the theatre, and the Aguila de Oro.... The
Plaza de Toros, of course, he would frequent: it
was on Belascoin Street near the sea. The afternoon
fights only were fashionable; the bulls
killed in the morning were no more than toro
del aguadiente. And the cockpit was at the
Valla de Gallo.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>There were other suggestions as well, put
mostly in the form of ribald inquiry; but toward
them Charles Abbott persisted in an attitude of
uncommunicative disdain. His mind, his whole
determination, had been singularly purified; he
had a sensation of remoteness from the flesh; his
purpose killed earthly desire. He thought of
himself now as dedicated to that: Charles reviewed
the comfortable amount of his letter of
credit, his personal qualifications, the derringer
mounted in mother-of-pearl, in the light of one
end. It annoyed him that he couldn&#8217;t, at once,
plunge into this with Domingo Escobar; but,
whenever he approached that ordinarily responsive
gentleman with anything political, he grew
morose and silent, or else, more maddening still,
deliberately put Charles&#8217; interest aside. The
derringer, however, brought out an unexpected
and gratifying stir.</p>
<p>Escobar had stopped in Charles&#8217; cabin, and
the latter, with a studied air of the casual, displayed
the weapon on his berth. &#8220;You must
throw it away,&#8221; Escobar exclaimed dramatically;
&#8220;at once, now, through the porthole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; Charles explained; &#8220;it was
a gift from my father; besides, I&#8217;m old enough
for such things.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>&#8220;A gift from your father, perhaps,&#8221; the other
echoed; &#8220;but did he tell you, I wonder, how you
were going to get it into Cuba? Did he explain
what the Spanish officials would do if they found
you with a pistol? Dama de Caridad, do you
suppose Cuba is New York! The best you
could hope for would be deportation. Into the
sea with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this Charles Abbott refused to do, though
he would, he agreed, conceal it beyond the ingenuity
of Spain; and Escobar left him in a muttering
anger. Charles felt decidedly encouraged:
a palpable degree of excitement, of tense anticipation,
had been granted him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Yet his first actual breath of the tropics, of
Cuba, was very different, charged and surcharged
with magical peace: the steamer was enveloped
in an evening of ineffable lovely blueness.
The sun faded from the world of water
and left an ultramarine undulating flood with
depths of clear black, the sky was a tender gauze
of color which, as night approached, was sewn
with a glimmer that became curiously apparent,
seemingly nearby, stars. The air that brushed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Charles&#8217; cheek was slow and warm; its warmth
was fuller, heavier with potency, than any summer
he had known. Accelerating his imagination it
dissipated his energies; he lounged supine in his
chair, long past midnight, lulled by the slight
rise and fall of the sea, gathered up benignly
into the beauty above him.</p>
<p>Later he had to stir himself into the energy
of packing, for the Morro Castle was docking
early in the morning. He closed his bag
thoughtfully, the derringer on a shelf. Escobar
had spoken about it, warning him, again; and
it was apparent that no obvious place of concealment
would be sufficient. At last he hit on an
excellent expedient&mdash;he would suspend it inside
the leg of a trouser. He fell asleep, still saturated
with the placid blue immensity without, and
woke sharply, while it was still dark. But it was
past four, and he rose and dressed. The deck
was empty, deserted, and the light in the pilot
house showed a solitary intent countenance
under a glazed visor. There was, of course, no
sign of Cuba.</p>
<p>A wind freshened, it blew steadily with no
change of temperature, like none of the winds
with which he was familiar. It appeared to
blow the night away, astern. The caged light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
grew dull, there were rifts in the darkness,
gleams over the tranquil sea, and the morning
opened like a flower sparkling in dew. The
limitless reach of the water flashed in silver
planes; miniature rainbows cascaded in the spray
at the steamer&#8217;s bow; a flight of sailing fish skittered
by the side. Far ahead there was a faint
silhouette, like the print of a tenuous green-grey
cloud, on the sea. It grew darker, bolder; and
Charles Abbott realized that it was an island.</p>
<p>Cuba came rapidly nearer; he could see now
that it wasn&#8217;t pale; its foliage was heavy, glossy,
almost sombre. The Morro Castle bore to the
left, but he was unable to make out an opening,
a possible city, on the coast. The water regained
its intense blue, at once transparent, clear, and
dyed with pigment. The other travellers were
all on deck: Charles moved toward Domingo
Escobar, but he eluded him. Undoubtedly
Escobar had the conjunction of the derringer
and the Spanish customs in mind. A general
uneasiness permeated the small throng; they conversed
with a forced triviality, or, sunk in
thought, said nothing.</p>
<p>Then, with the sudden drama of a crash of
brass, of an abruptly lifting curtain, they swung
into Havana harbor. Charles was simultaneously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
amazed at a great many things&mdash;the narrowness
of the entrance, the crowded ships in
what was no more than a rift of the sea, a long
pink fortress above him at the left, and the city,
Havana itself, immediately before him. His
utmost desire was satisfied by that first glimpse.
Why, he cried mentally, hadn&#8217;t he been told that
it was a city of white marble? That was the
impression it gave him&mdash;a miraculous whiteness,
a dream city, crowning the shining blue tide.</p>
<p>Every house was hung with balconies on long
shuttered windows, and everywhere were parks
and palms, tall palms with smooth pewter-like
trunks and short palms profusely leaved. Here,
then, white and green, was the place of his dedication;
he was a little dashed at its size and vigor
and brilliancy.</p>
<p>The steamer was scarcely moving when the
customs officials came on board; and, as the drift
ceased, a swarm of boats like scows with awnings
aft clustered about them. Hotel runners clambered
up the sides, and in an instant there was a
pandemonium of Spanish and disjointed English.
A man whose cap bore the sign Hotel
Telégrafo clutched Charles Abbott&#8217;s arm, but
he sharply drew away, repeating the single word,
&#8220;Inglaterra!&#8221; The porter of that hotel soon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
discovered him, and, with a fixed reassuring
smile, got together all the baggage for his guests.</p>
<p>Charles, instructed by Domingo Escobar, ignored
the demand for passports, and proceeded
to the boat indicated as the Inglaterra&#8217;s. It was
piled with luggage, practically awash; yet the
boatmen urged it ashore, to the custom house, in
a mad racing with the whole churning flotilla.
The rigor of the landing examination, Charles
thought impatiently, had been ridiculously exaggerated;
but, stepping into a hack, two men in
finely striped linen, carrying canes with green
tassels, peremptorily stopped him. Charles was
unable to grasp the intent of their rapid Spanish,
when one ran his hands dexterously over his
body. He explored the pockets, tapped Charles&#8217;
back, and then drew aside. When, at last, he was
seated in the hack, the position of the derringer
was awkward, and carefully he shifted it.</p>
<p>An intimate view of Havana increased rather
than diminished its evident charms. The heat,
Charles found, though extreme, was less oppressive
than the dazzling light; the sun blazing on
white walls, on walls of primrose and cobalt,
in the wide verdant openings, positively blinded
him. He passed narrow streets over which awnings
were hung from house to house, statues,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
fountains, a broad way with files of unfamiliar
trees, and stopped with a clatter before the Inglaterra.</p>
<p>It faced on a broad covered pavement, an
arcade, along which, farther down, were companies
of small iron tables and chairs; and it was
so foreign to Charles, so fascinating, that he
stood lost in gazing. A hotel servant in white,
at his elbow, recalled the necessity of immediate
arrangements, and he went on into a high cool
corridor set with a marble flooring. At the office
he exchanged his passport for a solemn printed
warning and interminable succession of directions;
and then, climbing an impressive stair, he
was ushered into a room where the ceiling was so
far above him that once more he was overcome
by strangeness and surprise.</p>
<p>He unpacked slowly, with a gratifying sense
of the mature significance of his every gesture;
and, in the stone tub hidden by a curtain in a
corner, had a refreshing bath. There was a
single window rising from the tiled floor eight or
ten feet, and he opened double shutters, discovering
a shallow iron-railed balcony. Before him
was a squat yellow building with a wide complicated
façade; it reached back for a square, and
Charles decided that it was the Tacon Theatre.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
On the left was the Parque de Isabel, with its
grass plots and gravel walks, its trees and iron
settees, gathered about the statue of Isabel II.</p>
<p>Charles Abbott&#8217;s confidence left him little by
little; what had seemed so easy in New York, so
apparent, was uncertain with Havana about him.
The careless insolence of the inspectors with the
green-tasseled canes at once filled him with indignation
and depression. How was he to begin
his mission? Without a word of Spanish he
couldn&#8217;t even make it known. There was
Andrés Escobar to consider: his father had told
Charles that he knew a few words of English.
Meanwhile, hungry, he went down to the eleven
o&#8217;clock breakfast.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>A ceremonious head waiter led him to a small
table by a long window on the Parque, where,
gazing hastily at the breakfasts around him, he
managed, with the assistance of his waiter&#8217;s
limited English, to repeat their principal features.
These were fruit and salads, coffee flavored
with salt, and French bread. Clear white
curtains swung at the window in a barely perceptible
current of air, and he had glimpses of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
expanse without, now veiled and now intolerably
brilliant. His dissatisfaction, doubts, vanished
in an extraordinary sense of well-being, or settled
importance and elegance. There were many
people in the dining-room, it was filled with the
unfamiliar sound of Spanish; the men, dark,
bearded and brilliant-eyed, in white linens, with
their excitable hands, specially engaged his attention,
for it was to them he was addressed.</p>
<p>The women he glanced over with a detached
and indulgent manner: they were, on the whole,
a little fatter than necessary; but their voices
were soft and their dress and jewels, even so
early in the day, nicely elaborate. All his interest
was directed to the Cubans present; other travellers,
like&mdash;or, rather, unlike&mdash;himself, Americans,
French and English, planning in their
loud several tongues the day&#8217;s excursions, or
breakfasting with gazes fastened on Hingray&#8217;s
English and Spanish Conversations, Charles
carefully ignored.</p>
<p>He felt, because of the depth of his own implication,
his passionate self-commitment, here,
infinitely superior to more casual, to blinder,
journeyings. He disliked the English arrogance,
the American clothes, and the suspicious parsimony
of the French. Outside, in the main corridor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
of the hotel, he paused undecided; practically
no one, he saw, in the Parque Isabel, was
walking; there was an unending broad stream of
single horse victorias for hire; but he couldn&#8217;t
ask any driver he saw to conduct him to the
heart of the Cuban party of liberty.</p>
<p>The strongest of all his recognitions was the
fact that he had no desire&mdash;but a marked distaste&mdash;for
sightseeing; he didn&#8217;t want to be identified,
in the eyes of Havana, with the circulating
throng of the superficially curious. In the end
he strolled away from the Inglaterra, to the left,
and discovered the Prado. It was a wide avenue
with the promenade in the center shaded by rows
of trees with small burnished leaves. There, he
remembered, was where the Escobars lived, and
he wondered which of the imposing dwellings,
blue or white, with sweeping pillars and carved
balconies and great iron-bound doors, was theirs.
He passed a fencing school and gymnasium; a
dilapidated theatre of wood pasted with old
French playbills; fountains with lions&#8217; heads;
and came to the sea. It reached in an idyllic
and unstirred blue away to the flawless horizon,
with, on the rocks of its shore, a company of
parti-colored bath-houses. There was an old
fort, a gate&mdash;which, he could see, once formed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
part of the city wall&mdash;bearing on its top a row
of rusted and antiquated cannon. Slopes of
earth led down from the battery, and beyond he
entered a covered stone way with a parapet dropping
to the tranquil tide. After an open space,
the Maestranza, he came to a pretty walk; it was
the Paseo de Valdez, with trees, stone seats and
a rippling breeze.</p>
<p>Charles Abbott indolently examined an arch,
fallen into disrepair, erected, its tablet informed
him, by the corps of Royal Engineers. He sat on
a bench, saturated by the hot vivid peace; before
him reached the narrow entrance of the bay with,
on the farther hand, the long pink wall of the
Cabañas. A drift of military music came to him
from the fortress.... A great love for Havana
stirred in his heart; already, after only a few
hours, he was familiar, contented, there. It
seemed to Charles that he understood its spirit;
the beauty of palms and marble was what, in the
bleak north, all his life he had longed for. The
constriction of his breathing had vanished.</p>
<p>The necessity for an immediate and violent
action had lessened; he would, when the time
came, act; he was practically unlimited in days
and money. Charles decided, however, to begin
at once the study of Spanish; and he&#8217;d arrange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
for lessons at the Fencing School. Both of those
accomplishments were imperative to his final intention.
He lingered on the beach without an inclination
to move&mdash;he had been lower physically
than he realized. The heat increased, the breeze
and band stopped, and finally he rose and returned
to the Inglaterra. There the high cool
shadow of his room was so soothing that he fell
into a sound slumber and was waked only by a
pounding at his door past the middle of afternoon.</p>
<p>A servant tendered him a card that bore engraved
the name Andrés Escobar. He would see
Mr. Escobar, he sent word, as soon as he could
be dressed. And, choosing his garb in a mingling
of haste and particular care, he was permeated
by an indefinable excitement. Facing
Andrés, he had a sensation of his own clumsiness,
his inept attitude; for the other, younger than
he in appearance, was faultless in bearing: in
immaculately ironed linen, a lavender tie and
sprig of mimosa, he was an impressive figure of
the best fashion. But Andrés Escobar was far
more than that: his sensitive delicately modelled
dark face, the clear brown eyes and level lips,
were stamped with a superfine personality.</p>
<p>His English, as his father had said, was halting,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
confined to the merest formal phrases, but
his tones were warm with hospitality.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was polite of you to come so soon,&#8221; Charles
replied; &#8220;and your father was splendid to me on
the steamer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you like Havana?&#8221; Andrés asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love it!&#8221; Charles Abbott exclaimed, in a
burst of enthusiasm, but of which, immediately
after, he was ashamed. &#8220;I was thinking this
morning,&#8221; he continued more stiffly, &#8220;when I
had hardly got here, how much at home I felt.
That&#8217;s funny, too; for it&#8217;s entirely different from
all I have known.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You like it!&#8221; Andrés Escobar reflected his
unreserved tone. &#8220;That&#8217;s good; I am very, very
glad. You must come to our house, Papa sends
you this.&#8221; He smiled delightfully.</p>
<p>They were standing, and Charles waved toward
the dining-room. &#8220;Suppose we go in there and
have a drink.&#8221; In Havana he continually
found himself in situations of the most gratifying
maturity&mdash;here he was, in the dining-room of
the Inglaterra Hotel, with a tall rum punch before
him, and a mature looking cigar. He was a
little doubtful about the latter, its length was formidable;
and he delayed lighting it until Andrés
had partly eclipsed himself in smoke. But, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
his private satisfaction, Charles enjoyed the cigar
completely.</p>
<p>He liked his companion enormously, noticing,
as they sat in a comfortable silence, fresh details:
Andrés&#8217; hair, ink-black, grew in a peak on his
forehead; the silk case which held his cigars
was bound in gold; his narrow shoes were patent
leather with high heels. But what, above all
else, impressed Charles, was his evidently worldly
poise, the palpable air of experience that clung
to him. Andrés was at once younger and much
older than himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you interested?&#8221; Andrés asked,
&#8220;in ... girls? I know some very nice ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; Charles Abbott replied
decidedly; &#8220;the only thing I care for is politics
and the cause of justice and freedom.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Andrés Escobar gazed swiftly at the occupied
tables around them; not far away there was a
party of Spanish officers in loose short tunics and
blue trousers. Then, without commenting on
Charles&#8217; assertion, he drank from his glass of
punch. &#8220;Some very nice girls,&#8221; he repeated.
Charles was overwhelmed with chagrin at his indiscretion;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
Andrés would think that he was a
babbling idiot. At the same time he was
slightly impatient: his faith in the dangers of
Havana had been shaken by the city&#8217;s aspect of
profound placidity, its air of unalloyed pleasure.
&#8220;You should know my friends,&#8221; Andrés went on
conversationally; &#8220;Remigio Florez, they are
great coffee planters, and Jaime&mdash;Jaime Quintara&mdash;and
Tirso Labrador. They will welcome you,
as I.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles explained his intention of learning
Spanish, of fencing; and the other promised his
unreserved assistance. He would have a teacher
of languages sent to the hotel and himself take
Charles to the Fencing School. &#8220;Tomorrow,&#8221;
he promised. The drinks were finished, the
cigars consumed in long ashes, and Andrés Escobar
rose to go. As they walked toward the Paseo
the Cuban said, &#8220;You must be very careful,
liberty is a dangerous word; it is discussed only
in private; in our tertulia you may speak.&#8221;
He held out a straight forward palm. &#8220;We
shall be friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again in his room, Charles dwelt on Andrés,
conscious of the birth of a great liking, the
friendship the other had put into words. He
wanted to be like Andrés, as slender and graceful,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
with his hair in a peak and a worldly, contained
manner. Charles was thin, rather than
slender, more awkward than not; decidedly fragile
in appearance. And his experience of life
had been less than nothing. Yet he would make
up for this lack by the fervor of his attachment
to the cause of Cuba. He recalled all the stories
he knew of foreign soldiers heroic in an adopted
cause; that was an even more ideal form of service
than the natural attachment to a land of
birth.</p>
<p>He moved a chair out on his balcony, and
sat above the extended irregular roof of the
Tacon Theatre, watching the dusk flood the
white marble ways. The lengthening shadows of
the Parque blurred, joined in one; the façades
were golden and then dimly violet; the Gate of
Montserrat lost its boldness of outline. Cries
rose from the streets, &#8220;Cuidado! Cuidado!&#8221; and
&#8220;Narranjas, narranjas dulces.&#8221; The evening
news sheets were called in long falling inflections.</p>
<p>What surprised him was that, although he had
more than an ordinary affection for his home,
his father and mother, now, here, they were of
no importance, no reality, to him. He never,
except by an objective effort, gave the north, the
past, a thought. He was carried above personal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
relationships and familiar regard; at a blow his
old ties had been severed; the new held him in
the grip of their infinite possibilities. All the
petty things of self were obscured in the same
way that the individual aspects of the city below
him were being merged into one dignity of tone.</p>
<p>Yet, at the same time, his mood had a charming
reality&mdash;the suaveness of Andrés Escobar.
His, Charles Abbott&#8217;s, would be a select, an aristocratic,
fate; the end, when it overtook him,
would find him in beautiful snowy linens, dignified,
exclusive, to the last. His would be no
pot-house brawling. That was his double
necessity, the highest form of good in circumstances
of the first breeding. One, perhaps, to
his &#230;sthetic fibre, was as important as the other.
And, dressing for dinner, he spoiled three shirts
in the exact right fixing of his studs.</p>
<p>In the dining-room, he pressed a liberal sum
of American money on the head waiter, and was
conducted to the table he had occupied at breakfast.
Everyone, practically, except some unspeakable
tourists, was in formal clothes; and
the conversations, the sparkling light, were like
the champagne everywhere evident. Charles
chose a Spanish wine, the Marquis de Riscal;
and prolonged his sitting over coffee and a cigar,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
a Partagas, like those in Andrés&#8217; silk case. He
had never before tasted coffee with such a rich
thick savor, its fragrance alone, blending with the
blue smoke of his cigar, filled him with pleasure.</p>
<p>The room was long, tiled, and had, against
the far wall, a great mirror which held in reverse
the gay sweep of the tables, the heavily powdered
shoulders of women, the prismatic flashes of
diamonds and men&#8217;s animated faces. The reflections
were almost as fascinating as the reality,
and Charles gazed from one to the other.</p>
<p>Drinking, he saw, was universal, but none of
the Cubans were drunk; and for that reason his
attention was held by two men at the table next
to his: the waiter had left a bottle of brandy, and
the individual facing Charles, with a sallow face
from which depended, like a curtain, a square-cut
black beard, was filling and refilling his
thimble-sized glass. He was watching, with a
shifting intentness of gaze, all who entered; and
suddenly, as Charles&#8217; eyes were on him, he put
down his half-lifted brandy and a hand went
under the fold of his coat.</p>
<p>Charles turned, involuntarily, and saw a
small immaculate Cuban with grey hair and a
ribband in his buttonhole advancing among the
tables. He was a man of distinguished appearance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
important it was evident, for a marked
number of people bowed as he passed. When he
had gone on, the bearded individual rose, swaying
slightly, and, with his hand still in his coat
rapidly overtook the other.</p>
<p>Charles Abbott had an impulse to cry out;
but, oppressed by a sense of helpless dread, impending
disaster, without a sound or power of
movement he followed the course of the second
figure. The two were now at the end of the
dining-room, close to the mirror, when the man
with the decoration stopped and turned sharply.
There was the sudden stabbing report of a pistol,
and, immediately following, a loud splintering
crash. Charles had the crazy illusion that a
man who had been shot was made of china, and
would be found in broken bits on the floor.</p>
<p>There was an instantaneous hysterical uproar,
dominated by the screams of women; in the panic
which rose there was a rush for the entrance, a
swirl of tearing satin and black dress coats.
Then, even before he heard the concerted derisive
amazement, Charles realized that, dazed
by the brandy, the intended murderer had fired
at the reflection of his mark in the glass.</p>
<p>What an utterly ridiculous error; and yet his
hands were wet and cold, his heart pounding.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
Something of the masking gaiety, the appearance
of innocent high spirits, was stripped from
the dining-room of the Inglaterra, from Havana.
There was an imperative need for Andrés Escobar&#8217;s
caution. Charles&#8217; equanimity returned:
with a steady hand he poured out more coffee.
He was ashamed of his emotion; but, by heaven,
that was the first of such violence he had witnessed;
he knew that it happened, to a large
degree its possibility had brought him to Cuba;
yet directly before him, in a square beard and
a decorating ribband!... On the floor were the
torn painted gauze and broken ivory sticks of a
woman&#8217;s fan.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The echo of that futile shot followed Charles
Abbott to the Escobars&#8217;, where, because of the
often repeated names of its principals, he recognized
that the affair was being minutely discussed.
The room in which they sat was octagonal,
with the high panels of its walls no more
than frames for towering glass doors set in
dark wood; above were serrated openings, Eastern
in form, and the doors were supported by
paired columns of glacial white marble. It was
entered through a long corridor of pillars capped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
in black onyx with wicker chairs, a tiling laid in
arabesques and potted palms; and opposite was
the balcony over the Prado. A chandelier of
crystal, hanging by a chain from the remote ceiling,
with a frosted sparkle like an illuminated
wedding cake, unaffected by prismatic green and
red flashes, filled the interior with a chilly brightness.
The chairs of pale gilt set in a circle,
the marble pattern of the floor, the dark heads
of the Escobars, looked as though they were
bathed in a vitreous fluid preserving them in a
hard pallor forever.</p>
<p>But it was cool; the beginning constant night
breeze fluttered the window curtains and swayed
the pennants of smoke from the cigars. Domingo
Escobar finished what was evidently a
satirical period with a decisive clearing of his
throat&mdash;a-ha! He was a small rotund man with
a gigantic moustache laid without a brown hair
misplaced over a mouth kindly and petulant.
His wife, Carmita, obese with indulgent indolence,
her placid expression faintly acid,
waved a little hand, like a blanched almond, indicative
of her endless surprise at the clamor of
men. Andrés was silent, immobile, faultless in
a severity of black and white.</p>
<p>Charles had begun to admire him inordinately:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
above everything, Andrés possessed a simple
warmness of heart, a generosity of emotion,
together with a fastidious mind. Fortunate
combination. And his person, his gestures
and flashing speech, his brooding, were invested
by an intangible quality of romance;
whatever he did was absorbing, dramatic and&mdash;and
fateful. He was a trifle aloof, in spite of
his impulsive humanity, a thought withdrawn as
though by a shadow that might have been but
his unfailing dignity.</p>
<p>Charles&#8217; gaze wandered from him to Narcisa,
who, Domingo Escobar had said, resembled a
flower bud. As she sat in pale yellow ruffles,
with her slim hands clasped and her composed
face framed in a wide dense stream of hair, she
was decidedly fetching. Or, rather, she gave promise
of charm; at present, she was too young to engage
him in any considerable degree. Narcisa, he
concluded, was fourteen. At very long intervals
she looked up and he caught a lustrous, momentary
interrogation of big black eyes. A very
satisfactory sister for Andrés Escobar to have;
and, wondering at the absence of Vincente, the eldest
son, Charles asked Andrés about his brother.</p>
<p>A marked constraint was immediately visible
in the family around him. Vincente, he was informed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
abruptly, was out of Havana, he had
had to go to Matanzas. Later, on the balcony
over the Prado, Andrés added an absorbing detail.
&#8220;Vincente, we think, is in the Party of
Liberation. But you must say nothing. I do
not know, Vincente will not speak; but mama has
noticed the gendarmes in front of the house, and
when she drives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to talk to him,&#8221; Charles Abbott
declared; &#8220;you must arrange it for me. Look
here, there&#8217;s nobody around, I might as well tell
you that&#8217;s why I came to Cuba, to fight the cursed
Spanish. I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m serious, there&#8217;s nothing I
wouldn&#8217;t do; and if I have to be killed, why, I
am ready for that. It&#8217;s all worked out in my
head, except some petty little details. Cuba
ought to be free; this oppression is horrible, like
a spell on you&mdash;you&#8217;re all afraid to more than
whisper&mdash;that must be broken. It must! I
have a good little bit of money and I can get
more. You&#8217;ve got to help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrés clasped his hand. &#8220;That is wonderful!&#8221;
His lowered exclamation vibrated with
feeling. &#8220;How can you have such nobility!
I am given to it, and Jaime and Remigio Florez
and Tirso. But we are going to wait, we think
that is better; Spain shall pay us when the time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
comes. Those students, eight of them, who were
shot, were well known to us. They put them
against a wall by the prison and fired. You could
hear it clearly. But, when we are ready, the
Spanish Volunteers&mdash;&#8221; hatred closed his throat,
drew him up rigidly. &#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he insisted;
&#8220;this shall be different, forever. Perhaps your
country will help us then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles was increasingly impatient; he
couldn&#8217;t, he felt, wait, delay his gesture for freedom.
He conceived the idea that he might kill
the Captain-General of Spain in Cuba, shoot
him from the step of his carriage and cry that it
was a memorial of the innocent boys he had murdered.
Andrés dissuaded him; it would, he
said, only make the conditions of living more
difficult, harsh, put off the other, the final, consummation.</p>
<p>Below, on the promenade, the rows of gas
lamps shone wanly through the close leaves of
the India laurels; there was a ceaseless sauntering
throng of men; then, from the Plaza de
Armas, there was the hollow rattat of drums, of
tattoo. It was nine o&#8217;clock. The night was
magnificent, and Charles Abbott was choked by
his emotions; it seemed to him that his heart
must burst with its expanding desire of heroic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
good. He had left the earth for cloudy glories,
his blood turned to a silver essence distilled in
ethereal honor; he was no longer a body, but a
vow, a purpose.</p>
<p>One thing, in a surpassing humility, he decided,
and turned to Andrés. &#8220;Very well, if you
think the other is best. Listen to me: I swear
never to leave Cuba, never to have a different
thought or a hope, never to consider myself at all,
until you are free.&#8221;</p>
<p>The intent face of Andrés Escobar, dim in the
gloom of the balcony, was like a holy seal upon
his dedication. A clatter of hoofs rose from below&mdash;the
passage of a squad of the gendarmes
on grey horses, their white coats a chalky glimmer
in the night. Andrés and Charles watched
them until they vanished toward the Parque
Isabel; then Andrés swore, softly.</p>
<p>Again in his room at the Inglaterra Charles
speculated about the complications of his determination
to stay in Cuba until it was liberated
from Spain. That, he began to realize, might
require years. Questions far more difficult rose
than any created by a mere immediate sacrifice;
the attitude of his father, for example; he, conceivably,
would try to force him home, shut off
the supply of money. Meanwhile, since the Inglaterra
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
was quite expensive, he would move to a
less pretentious place. And, in the morning,
Charles installed himself at the Hotel San Felipe,
kept on Ancha del Norte Street, near the bay, by
a German woman.</p>
<p>His room was on the top floor, on, really, a
gallery leading to the open roof that was much
frequented after dinner in a cooling air which
bore the restrained masculine chords of guitars.
On the right he could see the flares of Morro
Castle, and, farther, the western coast lying black
on the sea. He had his room there, and the first
breakfast, but his formal breakfast and dinner he
took at the Restaurant Français, the Aguila
d&#8217;Oro, or the Café Dominica. Late, with Andrés
and their circle, their tertulia, Charles would idle
at the El Louvre over ice-cream or the sherbets
called helados in Havana. On such occasions
they talked with a studied audible care of the
most frivolous things; while Charles cherished
close at heart the sensation of their dangerous
secret and patient wisdom, the assurance that
some day their sacred resolution would like
lightning shatter their pretence of docility.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>Yet, in spite of the dark texture of their minds,
they were, at times, casually happy, intent, together,
on mundane affairs. They were, all
five, inseparable: Jaime Quintara, the eldest,
was even more of an exquisite than Andrés; he
imported his lemon-colored gloves by the box
from Paris, where they were made to his measure;
and in them, it was the common jest, he went to
bed. He was almost fat, with absurdly small
feet and a perceptible moustache. In addition,
he was in love with a public girl who lived on
Gloria Street; altogether he was a man of the
world. Remigio Florez was absolutely different:
the son of a great coffee estate in Pinar del
Rio, of limitless riches, he was still simple and
unaffected, short, with a round cheerful face and
innocent lips. Tirso Labrador was tall and
heavy, he had the carriage of a cavalry officer,
a dragoon; and, slow mentally, his chief characteristic
was a remarkable steadfastness, a loyalty
of friendship, admiration, for his more brilliant
companions. Tirso Labrador was very strong,
and it was his boast, when they were alone, that
he intended to choke a Spaniard slowly to death
with his naked hands.</p>
<p>Except, however, for the evening, Charles was
rarely idle; upheld by his fervor he studied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
Spanish with an instructor through most of the
morning, and rode or fenced in the sala in the
afternoon. His knowledge of Spanish, supplemented
by his friends, grew rapidly; he had, his
teacher declared, a very special aptitude for the
language. Domingo Escobar got great delight
from throwing sentences, queries, at him with inconceivable
rapidity, and in pretending that every
reply Charles attempted was senseless.</p>
<p>Narcisa, when he was present, contrived to sit
with her gaze on her hands folded in her ruffled
lap and to lift her widely opened eyes for breathless
interrogations. She was, Charles was forced
to admit, notably pretty; in fact, for a little girl,
she was a beauty. Now if she had been thirty
he might have had a hopeless passion for her,
hopeless not because she failed to return it, but
for the reason that he was a man without a
future&mdash;some day, they both knew, he would
desert love for stark death.</p>
<p>They went, Charles and Andrés, Tirso and
Remigio and Jaime, to the Tacon Theatre for
every play, where they occupied a box in the first
row, the primer piso, and lounged, between the
acts, on the velvet rail with their high silk hats
and canes and boutonnières. At times there were
capital troupes of players and dancers from Andalusia,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
and the evening was well spent. They
liked, too, the zarzuelas, the operettas of one act,
largely improvised with local allusions. But they
most warmly applauded the dancers.</p>
<p>One, La Clavel, from Seville, had been announced
by posters all over the city; and, at the
moment she appeared on the Tacon stage, Tirso
had his heavy arm about Remigio&#8217;s shoulders,
Jaime&#8217;s gloved hands were draped over his cane,
and Charles was sitting in the rear of the box
with Andrés. The orchestra began a sharply
accented dance measure&mdash;it was a jota&mdash;and a
lithe figure in a mantón of blazing silks and a
raked black felt hat made a sultry bow.</p>
<p>La Clavel was indolent; she tapped a heel
and sounded her castanets experimentally; a
reminiscent smile hovered on the sombre beauty
of her face. Suddenly Charles&#8217; attention was
wholly captured by the dancer; he leaned forward,
gazing over Remigio&#8217;s shoulder, vaguely
conscious of the sound of guitars and suppressed
drums, the insistent ring of a triangle. She
stamped her foot now, and the castanets were
sharp, exasperated. Then slowly she began to
dance.</p>
<p>She wove a design of simple grace with her
hips still and her arms lifted and swaying; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
leaned back, her eyes, under the slanted brim of
her hat, half closed; and her movements, the
rhythm, grew more pronounced. Through the
music Charles could hear the stamp of her heels,
the augmented shrilling of the castanets. Her
fire increased; there were great scarlet peonies
on her shawl, and they fluttered as though they
were troubled by a rising wind. La Clavel
swept in a widening circle on her hips, and her
arms were now extended and now thrust down
rigidly behind her.</p>
<p>She dominated the cruel colors of her shawl
with a savage intensity that made them but the
expressions of her feelings&mdash;the scarlet and magenta
and burning orange and blue were her
visible moods, her capriciousness and contempt
and variability and searing passion. Her hat
was flung across the stage, and, with her bound
hair shaking loose from its high shell comb, she
swept into an appalling fury, a tormented human
flame, of ecstasy. When Charles Abbott felt that
he could support it no longer, suddenly she was,
apparently, frozen in the immobility of a stone;
the knotted fringe of her mantón hung without
a quiver.</p>
<p>An uproar of applause rose from the theatre,
a confusion of cries, of Olé! Olé!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
Anda! Anda! Chiquella! A flight of
men&#8217;s hats sailed like birds around her. Jaime
Quintara pounded his cane until it broke, and,
with the others, Charles shouted his unrestrained
Spanish approbation. They crowded into the
front of the box, intent on every movement, every
aspect, of the dancer. Afterwards, at the Tuileries,
Andrés expressed their concerted feeling:</p>
<p>&#8220;The most magnificent woman alive!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jaime went across the café to speak to a man
who had a connection with the Tacon Theatre.
He returned with an assortment of information&mdash;La
Clavel was staying at the St. Louis; she would
be in Havana for a month; and she had been seen
with Captain Ceaza y Santacilla, of the regiment
of Isabel II. This latter fact cast them into a
gloom; and Remigio Florez so far broke the ban
of sustained caution as to swear, in the name of
the Lady of Caridad, at Santacilla and his kind.</p>
<p>Nothing, though, could reduce their enthusiasm
for La Clavel; they worshipped her severally
and together, discussing to the last shading
her every characteristic. She was young, but already
the greatest dancer the world had&mdash;would
ever have, Charles added. And Andrés was instructed
to secure the box for her every appearance
in Havana; they must learn, they decided,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
if she were to dance in Santiago de Cuba, in
Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Lima, in Cathay.
They, if it were mortally possible, would be
present. Meanwhile none of them was to take
advantage of the others in the contingency that
she should miraculously come to love him.
That incredible happiness the individual must
sacrifice to his friendship, to his oath above all
other oaths&mdash;Cuba. The country&#8217;s name was not
spoken, but it was entirely understood.</p>
<p>They were seated on the lower floor, by the
stairs which led up to the salon for women; and,
sharply, Charles grasped Andrés&#8217; arm. Passing
them was a slender woman muffled in a black
silk capote, with no hat to cover the intricate
mass of her hair piled against a high comb. Behind
her strode a Spanish officer of cavalry, his
burnished scabbard hooked on his belt against its
silver chain; short, with a thick sanguine neck
above the band of his tunic, he had morose pale
blue eyes and the red hair of compounded but
distinct bloods.</p>
<p>&#8220;La Clavel,&#8221; Charles whispered; &#8220;and it must
be that filthy captain, Santacilla, with her.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>Seated on the roof of the Hotel San Felipe,
the night&#8217;s trade wind faintly vibrant with
steel strings, Charles Abbott thought at length
about La Clavel. Two weeks had passed since
she first danced at the Tacon Theatre; she
had appeared on the stage three times afterward;
and she was a great success, a prodigious favorite,
in Havana. Charles and Andrés, Jaime and
Remigio and Tirso Labrador, had, frankly, become
infatuated with her; and it was this feeling
which Charles, at present, was examining. If
it endangered the other, his dedication to an ordeal
of right, he had decided, he must resolutely
put the dancer wholly outside his consideration.</p>
<p>This, he hoped, would not be necessary: his
feeling for La Clavel lay in the realm of the impersonal.
It was, in fact, parallel with the other
supreme cause. La Clavel was a glittering thing
of beauty, the perfection of all that in a happier
world, an Elysium&mdash;life and romance might be.
He regarded her in a mood of decided melancholy
as something greatly desirable and never to be
grasped. When she danced his every sensibility
was intensified; life, for the moment, was immeasurably
lovely, flooded with lyrical splendor,
vivid with gorgeous color and aching happiness.
Charles&#8217; pleasure in every circumstance of being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
was acutely expanded&mdash;his affection for Andrés,
the charm of Havana, the dignity of his impending
fate.</p>
<p>Ordinarily he would not have been content
with this; he would have striven to turn such
abstractions into the concrete of an actual experience.
But now an unusual wisdom held him intent
on the vision; that, he recognized, was real;
but what the reality, the woman herself, was,
who could be sure? No, he wasn&#8217;t in love with
La Clavel in the accepted sense of that indefinite
term; he was the slave of the illusion, the emotions,
she spun; he adored her as the goddess of
his youth and aspirations.</p>
<p>He tried to explain this, in halting and inadequate
Spanish, to his tertulia; and because of his
spirit rather than his words, his friends understood
him. They were standing by the marble
statue of Ferdinand VII in the Plaza de Armas,
waiting for the ceremony of Retrata, to begin in
a few moments. The square was made of four
gardens, separated by formal walks, with a circular
glorieta; and the gardens, the royal palms
and banyans and flambeau trees, were palely
lighted by gas lamps which showed, too, the circling
procession of carriages about the Plaza.
The square itself was filled with sauntering men,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
a shifting pattern of white linens, broad hats and
glimmering cigars, diversified by the uniforms of
Spain.</p>
<p>At eight o&#8217;clock a sergeant&#8217;s guard and the
band marched smartly into position before the
Governor-General&#8217;s palace, where they stood at
rest until the drums of the barracks announced
retreat. Then, at attention, the gun of El Morro
sounded, and the band swept into the strains of
Philemon et Baucis.</p>
<p>Jaime Quintara smiled sceptically at Charles&#8217;
periods: Platonic sentiments might satisfy Abbott,
he declared, but for himself.... At this,
Remigio insisted on their moving out to inspect
the carriages. They were, for the most part,
quitrins, drawn with two horses, one outside the
shafts ridden by a calesero in crimson velvet
laced with gold and a glazed hat. The quitrins
had two wheels, a leather hood strapped back,
and held three passengers by means of a small
additional seat, called, Andrés explained, la
niña bonita, where the prettiest woman was invariably
placed. None of the women wore hats,
but they were nearly all veiled, and the carriages
were burdened with seductive figures in wide
dresses of perfumed white waving slow fans.</p>
<p>There was, however, little conversation between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
the men on foot and the women carefully
cultivating expressions of remote unconcern.
Rarely, if she were accompanied by a masculine
member of her family, a woman came to earth
for a short stroll in the gardens. Charles was
absolutely inattentive to them, but his companions,
particularly Tirso and Jaime, noted and,
with dismaying freedom, commented on every
feminine detail that struck their fancy. It was
Tirso who excitedly called their attention to one
of the new volantas in which sat La Clavel.
Ceaza y Santacilla was not with her; the place at
her side was occupied by the man to whom Jaime
had spoken about the dancer in the Tuileries.
Quintara, capturing his attention, spoke in his
profoundest manner. There was a halt in the
movement of carriages, and La Clavel was directly
before them.</p>
<p>She wore the high comb and a mantilla of
black lace falling in scalloped folds around the
vivid flower of her face&mdash;her beauty, at least to
Charles, was so extraordinary, her dark loveliness
was so flaming, that the scarlet camellia in
her hair seemed wan. They were, all four, presented
to the dancer; and four extreme bows, four
fervid and sonorous acknowledgments, rose to
the grace, the divinity, above. It seemed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
Charles that, perhaps because he was an American,
La Clavel noticed him more than the others:
certainly she smiled at him and the brilliancy of
her gaze was veiled, made enigmatic, by the lowering
of her sweeping eyelashes.</p>
<p>The checked restlessness of the horses was
again released in a deliberate progress, but, as
La Clavel was carried on, the man with her
added that, after Retreta, they would stop at the
El Louvre for an ice cream, a mantecado.
Remigio Florez drew in a deep breath which he
allowed to escape in the form of a sigh; Jaime
smoothed the wrists of his bright yellow gloves;
Tirso Labrador settled his guardsman&#8217;s shoulders
into his coat. &#8220;She won&#8217;t get out of the volanta,&#8221;
Charles said thoughtfully; &#8220;and someone will
have to bring out her refresco. We&#8217;d better
get there early and stand at the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No hurry,&#8221; the suave Jaime put in; &#8220;no one
will leave here until after tattoo.&#8221;</p>
<p>At nine o&#8217;clock the drums and bugles sounded
from various parts of the city. There was one
more tune played directly under the palace windows,
after which the band and its guards left
briskly to the measure of a quickstep. Charles
led the way through the crowd to the Prado and
the Parque Isabel. A number of carriages were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
there before them, the occupants mostly eating
ices, and the café was being rapidly filled.
Waiting keen-eyed at the entrance, they saw the
volante with La Clavel before it drew up, and the
calesero had scarcely dismounted from his horse
when the dancer was offered her choice of the
available sweets. She preferred, rather than an
ice, an orchata, and sipped it slowly with an air
of complete enjoyment. Her every movement,
Charles Abbott saw, the turn of the hand holding
the glass, her chin and throat against the black
film of lace, her slender body&#8217;s poise, was utterly
and strongly graceful: it was, more than any
other quality, the vigor of her beauty that impressed
him. It seemed as though she must be
superbly young, and dance magnificently, forever.</p>
<p>As Charles was considering this he was unceremoniously
thrust aside for the passage of
Captain Santacilla with another cavalry officer
whose cinnamon colored face was stamped with
sultry ill-humor. Santacilla addressed the dancer
aggressively with the query of why she misspent
her evening with the cursed Cuban negroes.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>La Clavel made no reply, but tended her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
empty glass to Andrés; then she glanced indifferently
at the captains. &#8220;Their manners,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;are very pretty; and as for the negro&mdash;&#8221;
she shrugged her delectable shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;My blood is as pure, as Castilian, as your
own,&#8221; Tirso Labrador began hotly; but Remigio
stilled him with a hand on his arm. In an uncolored
voice he begged the dancer to excuse
them; and, sweeping off their hats, they were
leaving when Santacilla&#8217;s companion stepped
forward in a flash of ungoverned anger like an
exposed knife:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed you before,&#8221; he addressed Tirso,
&#8220;hanging and gabbling around the cafés and
theatres, and it&#8217;s my opinion you are an insurrectionist.
If the truth were known, I dare say,
it would be found you are a friend to Cespedes.
Anyhow, I&#8217;m tired of looking at you; if you are
not more retiring, you will find yourself in the
Cabañas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening,&#8221; Remigio repeated in an even
tone. With his hand still on Tirso&#8217;s arm he
tried to force him into the café; but the other,
dark with passion, broke away.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have dishonored my father and the name
of a heroic patriot,&#8221; he said to the officer of cavalry.
&#8220;In this I am alone.&#8221; With a suspicious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
quickness he leaned forward and his big hands
shut about the Spaniard&#8217;s throat.</p>
<p>Charles, with a suppressed exclamation, recalled
Tirso&#8217;s determination to choke one of the
enemies of Cuba. The man in the gripping fingers
stiffened and then, grotesquely, lost his aspect
of a human form; suddenly he was no more
than a thing of limp flesh and gay fabrics. Instantly
an uproar, a surging passionate excitement
grew, at the heart of which Tirso Labrador
was curiously still. Heaving bodies, at once
closing in and prudently scattering, hid from
Charles his friend. There was an onrush of
gendarmes, harsh exclamations and oaths; then,
at the flash of steel, a short agonized cry&mdash;Tirso&#8217;s
voice at once hoarse and inhuman with death.</p>
<p>Charles Abbott, hurrying away at Andrés&#8217; urgent
insistence, caught a final glimpse of a big
young body sunk on the flagging of the Paseo; he
saw a leaden face and a bubbling tide of blood.
Beyond the Montserrat gate they halted, and he
was shocked to hear Remigio Florez curse Tirso
as brutally as any Spaniard. Andrés, white and
trembling, agreed. &#8220;Here is what I warned you
of,&#8221; he turned to Charles; &#8220;it is fatal to lose
your temper. You think that what Tirso did
ends with him in purgatory ... ha! Perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
he is best out of it among us all. It might be
better for you to go back to America tomorrow
and forget about Cuba.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Remigio added, &#8220;probably we are all
ruined; and certainly the police spies will be
waiting for us at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have been better if we had dissipated
more,&#8221; Jaime added: &#8220;we have been entirely
too high-minded and unnatural. Young
men meet together only to conspire or find love&mdash;the
Spaniards know that and we were
fools.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t been suspected of anything,&#8221;
Andrés pointed out; &#8220;and it may be said that
Tirso was killed defending his name. No, the
trouble is to come; and it wasn&#8217;t our fault. We
must see less of each other, at least in public, and
be quite overcome about Tirso; that is another
account I charge to Spain: I knew him when I
was a child ... in the Vuelta Arriba&mdash;&#8221; Andrés
Escobar began to cry wholly and unaffectedly;
he leaned against an angle of the gate, his head
in an arm, and prolonged sobs shook his body.
Tears were silently streaming over Jaime&#8217;s face,
but Charles Abbott&#8217;s eyes were dry. He was filled
by an ecstasy of horror and detestation at the
brutal murder of Tirso. Fear closed his throat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
and pinched his heart with icy fingers; but he
ignored, rose above, himself, in a tremendous accession
of his determination to drive injustice&mdash;if
not yet from the world&mdash;from Cuba.</p>
<p>How little, he thought, anyone knew him who
advised a return to America. Before the cold
violent fact of death a great part of his early
melodramatic spirit evaporated; the last possible
trace of any self-glorification left him, the lingering
mock-heroics of boyhood were gone. His
emotion, now, was almost exultant; like a blaze
of insuperable white light it drowned all the individual
colors of his personality; it appeared to
him almost that he had left the earth, that he was
above other men.</p>
<p>More than anything, he continued, he would require
wisdom, the wisdom of patience, maturity;
Tirso had been completely wasted. He was
seated, again, on the roof of his hotel, and again
it was night: the guitars were like a distant
sounding of events evolved in harmonies, and
there was the gleam of moonlight on the sea, a
trace of the moon and the scent of mignonette
trees.</p>
<p>He was, he felt, very old, grave, in deportment;
this detachment from living must be the
mark of age. Charles had always been a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
removed from activity by sickness; and now his
almost solitary, dreaming habit of existence had
deepened in him. He thought, from time to time,
of other periods than his own, of ages when such
service as his had been, for gentlemen, the commonplace
of living: he saw, in imagination, before
the altar of a little chapel, under the glimmer
of tall candles, a boyish figure kneeling in armor
throughout the night. At morning, with a faint
clashing of steel, the young knight under a vow
rode into black forests of enchanted beasts and
men and impure magic, from which he delivered
the innocent and the pure in heart.</p>
<p>Charles Abbott recalled the burning of the
Protestant Cranmer, and, as well, the execution
of John Felton for posting the Papal bull against
the Queen on the door of London House. They
too, like the knights of Arthurian legend, had
conquered the flesh for an ideal. He was carried
in spirit into a whole world of transcendent
courage, into a company who scorned ease and
safety in the preservation of an integrity, a devotion,
above self. This gave him a release, the
sense that his body was immaterial, that filled
him with a calm serious fervor.</p>
<p>He was conscious, through this, of the ceaseless
playing of the guitars, strains of jotas and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
malagueñas, laden with the seductiveness, the
fascination, of sensuous warm life. It was, in
its persistence, mocking; and finally it grew into
a bitter undertone to the elevation of his thought:
he wanted, like Savonarola, to bring to an end
the depravity of the city; he wanted to cleanse
Havana of everything but the blanched heavenly
ardor of his own dedication. The jotas continued
and the scent of mignonette increased. The
moon, slipping over the sea, shone with a vague
brightness on the leaves of the laurels below, on
the whiteness of marble walks, and in the liquid
gleam of fountains. A woman laughed with a
note of uncertainty and passion.... It was all
infinitely removed from him, not of the slightest
moment. What rose, dwelt, in Charles was a
breath of eternity, of infinitude; he was lost in a
vision of good beyond seasons, changeless, and
for all men whomsoever. It must come, he told
himself so tensely that he was certain he had cried
his conviction aloud. The music sustained its
burden of earthly desire to which the harsh whispering
rustle of the palm fronds added a sound
like a scoffing laughter.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>At the Plaza de Toros, the following Sunday
afternoon, Charles saw La Clavel; she was seated
on an upper tier near the stand of the musicians,
over the entrance for the bulls; and, in an audience
composed almost entirely of men, she was
brilliantly conspicuous in a flaming green mantón
embroidered in white petals; her mantilla
was white, and Charles could distinguish the
crimson blot of the flower by her cheek. The
brass horns and drums of the band were making
a rasping uproar, and the crowded wooden amphitheatre
was tense with excitement. Andrés
Escobar, beside Charles, was being gradually
won from a settled melancholy; and, in an interested
voice, he spoke to Charles about the espada,
José Ponce, who had not yet killed a bull in
Cuba, but who was a great hero of the ring in
Spain and South America.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is La Clavel,&#8221; Charles said by way of
reply; &#8220;she is with Captain Santacilla, and I
think, but I can&#8217;t be sure, the officer Tirso tried
to choke to death. What is his name&mdash;de Vaca,
Gaspar Arco de Vaca.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even that,&#8221; Andrés answered, &#8220;wasn&#8217;t accomplished.
La Clavel&#8217;s engagement in Havana is
over; I suppose it will be Buenos Aires next.
Do you remember how we swore to follow her all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
over the world, and how Tirso wanted to drag
her volanta in place of the horses? At heart, it&#8217;s
no doubt, she is Spanish, and yet.... There&#8217;s
the procession.&#8221;</p>
<p>The key bearer, splendid in velvet and gold
and silver, with a short cloak, rode into the ring
followed by the picadores on broken-down horses:
their legs were swathed in leather and their
jackets, of ruby and orange and emerald, were
set with expensive lace. They carried pikes with
iron points; while the banderilleros, on foot, with
hair long and knotted like a woman&#8217;s, hung their
bright cloaks over an arm and bore the darts gay
with paper rosettes.</p>
<p>The espada, José Ponce, was greeted with a
savage roar of approbation; he was dressed in
green velvet, his zouave jacket heavy with gold
bullion; and his lithe slender dark grace recalled
to Charles Abbott La Clavel. Charles paid little
attention to the bull fighting, for he was far in
the sky of his altruism; his presence at the Plaza
de Toros was merely mechanical, the routine of
his life in Havana. Across from him the banked
humanity in the cheaper seats à sol, exposed to the
full blaze of mid-afternoon, made a pattern without
individual significance; he heard the quick
bells of the mules that dragged out the dead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
bulls; a thick revolting odor rose from the hot
sand soaked with the blood and entrails of horses.</p>
<p>At times, half turning, he saw the brilliant
shawl of the dancer, and more than once he distinguished
her voice in the applause following a
specially skilful or daring pass. He thought of
her with a passionate admiration unaffected by
the realization that she had brought them the
worst of luck: perhaps any touch of Spain was
corrupting, fatal. And the sudden desire seized
him to talk to La Clavel and make sure that her
superb art was unshadowed by the disturbing
possibilities voiced by Andrés.</p>
<p>There were cries of fuego! fuego! and
Charles Abbott was conscious of a bull who had
proved indifferent to sport. A banderillero, fluttering
his cloak, stepped forward and planted in
the beast&#8217;s shoulder a dart that exploded loudly
with a spurt of flame and smoke; there was a
smothered bellow, and renewed activities went
forward below. &#8220;What a rotten show!&#8221; Charles
said to Andrés, and the latter accused him of being
a tender sentimentalist. José Ponce, Andrés
pronounced with satisfaction, was a great sword.
The espada was about to kill: he moved as gracefully
as though he were in the figure of a dance;
his thrust, as direct as a flash of lightning, went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
up to the hilt, and the vomiting bull fell in crashing
death at his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose, for a change, we go to the Aguila de
Oro,&#8221; Andrés suggested; &#8220;the air is better there.&#8221;
By that he meant that the café was relatively free
from Spaniards. The throng moved shoulder to
shoulder slowly to the doors; but Charles managed
to work his way constantly nearer the conspicuous
figure of La Clavel. He despaired,
however, of getting close to her, when an unforeseen
eddy of humanity separated the dancer from
her companions and threw her into Charles&#8217; path.
She recognized him immediately: but, checking
his formal salutation, she said, in a rapid lowered
voice, that she would very much like to see
him ... at the St. Louis late on the afternoon
of tomorrow. They were separated immediately,
leaving in Charles a sense of excited anticipation.
He joined Andrés soon after and told him
what had occurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is safe for you,&#8221; Andrés decided;
&#8220;you are an American, no one has yet connected
you with the cause of Cuba. But this woman&mdash;What
do we know of her?&mdash;you&#8217;ll have to be prudent!&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrés Escobar had grown severe in the last
week, he had hardened remarkably; his concentration,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
Charles felt, his bitterness, even excluded
his friends. Charles Abbott&#8217;s affection for him
increased daily; his love, really, for Andrés was
a part of all that was highest in him. Unlike
the love of any woman, Andrés made no demand
on him, what only mattered was what each intrinsically
was: there were no pretence, no weary
protestations, nothing beside the truth of their
mutual regard, their friendship. What Charles
possessed belonged equally, without demand, to
Andrés; they had, aside from their great preoccupation,
the same thoughts and prejudices, the
same taste in refrescos and beauty and clothes.
They discovered fresh identical tastes with a rush
of happiness.</p>
<p>It was, like the absorbing rest, immaterial, the
negation of ordinary aims and ideas of comfort
and self-seeking. Charles would have died for
Andrés, Andrés for Charles, without of a moment&#8217;s
hesitation; indeed, the base of their feeling lay
in the full recognition of that fact. This they
admitted simply, with no accent of exaggeration
or boasting: on the present plane of their being
it was the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p>At the Aguila de Oro, spinning the paddle of a
molinillo, and individual chocolate mill, Andrés
informed Charles that Vincente was home. &#8220;He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
has told me everything,&#8221; Andrés Escobar continued
with pride. &#8220;We are now more than Escobars&mdash;brother
Cubans. He has been both shot
and sabred and he has a malaria. But nearly all
his friends are dead. Soon, he says, we, Jaime
and Remigio&mdash;and, I added, you&mdash;will have to
go out. He is to let us know when and how.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the police know he is in Havana?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We think not; they haven&#8217;t been about the
house since the investigation of the de Vaca
affair, and our servants are not spies. You must
come and see Vincente this evening, for he may
leave at any hour. It seems that he is celebrated
for his bravery and the Spaniards have marked
him for special attention. Papa and mama are
dreadfully disturbed, and not only because of
him; for if he is discovered, all of us, yes, little
Narcisa, will be made to pay&mdash;to a horrible degree,
I can tell you.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There was, apparently, nothing unusual in the
situation at the Escobars&#8217; when Charles called in
the evening. The family, exactly as he had
known it, was assembled in the drawing-room,
conversing under the icy flood of the crystal chandelier.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
He found a chair by Narcisa, and
listened studiously to the colloquial Spanish, running
swiftly around the circle, alternating with
small thoughtful silences. Soon, however,
Charles Abbott could see that the atmosphere was
not normal&mdash;the vivacity palpably was forced
through the shadow of a secret apprehension.
Domingo Escobar made sudden seemingly irrelevant
gestures, Carmita sighed out of her rotundity.
Only Narcisa was beyond the general subdued
gloom: in her clear white dress, her clocked
white silk stockings, and the spread densely black
curtain of her hair, she was intent on a wondering
thought of her own. Her gaze, as usual, was
lowered to her loosely clasped hands; but, growing
conscious of Charles&#8217; regard, she looked up
quickly, and, holding his eyes, smiled at him
with an incomprehensible sweetness.</p>
<p>He regarded her with a gravity no more than
half actual&mdash;his mind was set upon Vincente&mdash;and
her even pallor was invaded by a slow soft
color. Charles nodded, entirely friendly, and she
turned away, so abruptly that her hair swung out
and momentarily hid her profile. He forgot her
immediately, for he had overheard, half understood,
an allusion to the Escobars&#8217; elder son.
With a growing impatience he interrogated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
Andrés, and the latter nodded a reassurance.
Then Andrés Escobar rose, punctiliously facing
his father&mdash;he would, with permission, take
Charles to the upper balconies, the wide view
from which he had never seen. Domingo was
plainly uneasy, displeased; but, after a long
frowning pause, gave his reluctant consent.
Charles Abbott was acutely aware of his heels
striking against the marble steps which, broad,
imposing and dark, led above. Vincente, it developed,
without actually being in hiding, was
limited to the scope of the upper hall, where,
partly screened in growing palms, its end formed
a small salon.</p>
<p>There was a glimmer of light though sword-like
leaves, and a lamp on an alabaster table set
in ormolu cast up its illumination on a face from
which every emotion had been banished by a
supreme weariness. Undoubtedly at one time
Vincente Escobar had been as handsome as
Andrés; more arbitrary, perhaps, with a touch of
impatience resembling petulance; the carriage,
the air, of a youth spoiled by unrestrained inclination
and society. The ghost of this still lingered
over him, in the movement of his slender
hands, the sharp upflinging of his chin; but it
was no more than a memento of a gay and utterly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
lost past. The weariness, Charles began to realize,
was the result of more than a spent physical
and mental being&mdash;Vincente was ill. He had
acquired a fever, it was brought out, in the
jungles of Camagüey.</p>
<p>At first he was wholly indifferent to Charles;
at the end of Andrés&#8217; enthusiastic introduction,
after a flawless but perfunctory courtesy, Vincente
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States is very important to us; we
have had to depend almost entirely on the New
York Junta for our life. We have hope, too, in
General Grant. Finally your country, that was
so successful in its liberation, will understand us
completely, and sweep Spain over the sea. But,
until that comes, we need only money and courage
in our, in Cuban, hearts. You are, I understand
from Andrés, rich; and you are generous,
you will give?&#8221;</p>
<p>That direct question, together with its hint at
the personal unimportance of his attachment to
a cause of pure justice, filled Charles with both
resentment and discomfort. He replied stiffly,
in halting but adequate Spanish, that there had
been a misunderstanding: &#8220;I am not rich; the
money I have you would think nothing&mdash;it might
buy a stand or two of rifles, but no more. What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
I had wanted to spend was myself, my belief in
Cuba. It seemed to me that might be worth
something&mdash;&#8221; he stopped, in the difficulty of giving
expression to his deep convictions; and
Andrés warmly grasped his hand. He held
Charles&#8217; palm and addressed his brother in a passionate
flood of protest and assertion: Charles
Abbott, his dear friend, was as good a patriot as
any Escobar, and they should all embrace him
in gratitude and welcome; he was, if not the gold
of the United States, its unselfish and devoted
heart; his presence here, his belief in them, was
an indication of what must follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he were killed,&#8221; Andrés explained. &#8220;That
alone would bring us an army; the indignation
of his land would fall like a mountain on our
enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, giving Charles a fresh view of his usefulness,
slightly cooled his ardor; he was willing
to accept it, in his exalted state he would make
any sacrifice for the ideal that had possessed him;
but there was an acceptance of brutal unsentimental
fact in the Latin fibre of the Escobars
foreign to his own more romantic conceptions.
Vincente wasn&#8217;t much carried away by the possibility
Andrés revealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d be got out of the way privately,&#8221; he explained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
in his drained voice; &#8220;polite letters and
no more, regrets, would be exchanged. The politicians
of Washington are not different from those
of Cuba. If he is wise he will see Havana as
an idler. Even you, Andrés, do not know yet
what is waiting for you. It is one thing to conspire
in a balcony on the Prado and another to lie
in the marshes of Camagüey. You cannot realize
how desperate Spain is with the debt left from
her wars with Morocco and Chile and Peru.
Cuba, for a number of years, has been her richest
possession. While the Spaniards were paying
taxes of three dollars and twenty some cents,
we, in Cuba, were paying six dollars and sixty-nine.
After our declaration of independence at
Manzanillo&mdash;&#8221; an eloquent pause left his hearers
to the contemplation of what had followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how it has gone with us,&#8221; Vincente
continued, almost exclusively to the younger Escobar.
&#8220;Carlos Cespedes left his practice of the
law at Bayamo for a desperate effort with less
than a hundred and thirty men. But they were
successful, and in a few weeks we had fifteen
thousand, with the constitution of a republican
government drawn. We ended slavery,&#8221; here,
for a breath, he addressed Charles Abbott. &#8220;But
in that,&#8221; he specified, &#8220;we were different from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
you. In the United States slavery was considered
as only a moral wrong. Your Civil War
was, after all, an affair of philanthropy; while
we freed the slaves for economic reasons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, our struggle went on,&#8221; he returned to
Andrés, &#8220;and we were victorious, with, at the
most, fifty thousand men against how many?
One, two, hundred thousand. And we began to
be recognized abroad, by Bolivia and Columbia
and the Mexican Congress. The best Cubans,
those like ourselves, were in sympathy with the
insurrection. Everything was bright, the climate,
too, was fighting for us; and then, Andrés,
we lost man after man, the bravest, the youngest,
first: they were murdered, as I may be tonight,
killed among the lianas, overtaken in the villages,
smothered in small detachments by great
forces, until now. And it is for that I have said
so much, when it is unnecessary to pronounce a
word. What do you think is our present situation?
What do you think I left of our splendid
effort in the interior? General Agramonte and
thirty-five men. That and no more!</p>
<p>&#8220;Their condition you may see in me&mdash;wasted,
hardly stronger than pigeons, and less than half
armed. What, do you think, one boy from Pennsylvania
is worth to that? Can he live without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
food more than half the time, without solid land
under his feet, without protection against the mosquitoes
and heat and tropical rains? And in
Havana: but remember your friend, Tirso Labrador!
You, Andrés, have no alternative; but
your Charles Abbott he would be a danger
rather than an assistance.&#8221; Charles, with a
prodigious effort at a calm self-control, answered
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very thoughtful, and it is right to
be cautious, but what you say is useless. Andrés
understands! I&#8217;d never be satisfied to be anything
except a Cuban patriot. It isn&#8217;t necessary
for you to understand that in a minute, an evening.
I might be no good in Camagüey, but I
am not as young as Tirso; I am more bitter and
patient. By heaven, I will do something, I
will be a part of your bravery! Not only the
soldiers in the field, not only Agramonte, but
sacrifice&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Charles&#8217; throat was closed, his words stopped,
by the intensity of his feeling; his longing to be
identified, lost, in the spirit of General Agramonte
and the faithful thirty-five burned into a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
desperation of unhappiness. Vincente Escobar,
it was evident, thought that he wasn&#8217;t capable
of sustaining such a trust. Still there was nothing
to be gained by protests, hot asseverations;
with difficulty he suppressed his resentment, and
sat, to all appearances, calm, engaged with a
cigar and attending Vincente&#8217;s irregular vehement
speech. Andrés was silent, dark and serious;
but the gaze he turned upon Charles was
warm with affection and admiration. Nothing,
Vincente insisted, could be done now; they must
wait and draw into their cause every possible
ultimate assistance and understanding. If the
truth were known, he repeated again and again,
the world would be at their feet.</p>
<p>Finally, his enthusiasm, his power, ebbed; his
yellow pinched face sank forward: he was so
spent, so delivered to a loose indifference of body,
that he might well have been dead. Charles
rose with a formal Spanish period voicing the
appreciation of the honor that had been his.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all worried about Vincente,&#8221; Andrés
proceeded, as they were descending the vault-like
stairs; &#8220;there is a shadow on him like bad
luck. But it may be no more than the fever.
Our mother thinks he needs only her love and
enough wine jelly.&#8221; They were again in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
drawing-room with the Escobars; and Charles
momentarily resumed the seat he had left beside
Narcisa.</p>
<p>Domingo and his wife were submerged in
gloomy reflection, and Andrés sat with his gaze
fixed on the marble, patterned in white and black,
of the floor. Suddenly Narcisa raised her head
with an air of rebellion. &#8220;It&#8217;s always like the
church,&#8221; she declared incredibly. &#8220;Everything
has got so old that I can&#8217;t bear it&mdash;Vincente as
good as dead and Andrés resembling a Jesuit
father! Must all my life go on in this funeral
march?&#8221; The elder Escobars regarded her in a
voiceless amazement; but Andrés said severely:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are too young to understand the tragedy
of Cuba or Vincente&#8217;s heroic spirit. I am
ashamed of you&mdash;before Charles Abbott.&#8221;</p>
<p>Narcisa rose and walked swiftly out upon the
balcony. They had been, it seemed to Charles,
rather ridiculous with her; it was hard on Narcisa
to have been thrust, at her age, into such a
serious affair. The Escobars, and particularly
Vincente, took their responsibility a little too
ponderously. Following a vague impulse, made
up both of his own slightly damaged pride and
a sympathy for Narcisa, he went out to the balcony
where she stood with her hands lightly resting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
on the railing. Veiled in the night, her youth
seemed more mysterious than immature; he was
conscious of an unsteady flutter at her unformed
breast; her face had an aspect of tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t mind them,&#8221; he told her; &#8220;they
are tremendously bothered because they see a
great deal farther than you can. The danger to
Vincente, too, in Havana, spies&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She interrupted him, looking away so that he
could see only a trace of her cheek against the
fragment fall of her hair. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t that, but
what Andrés said about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>This admission startled him, and he studied
Narcisa&mdash;her hands now tightly clasping the
iron railing&mdash;with a disturbed wonder. Was it
possible that she cared for him? At home,
ignored by a maturity such as his, she would
have been absorbed in the trivial activities of
girls of her own age. But Havana, the tropics,
was different. It was significant, as well, that
he was permitted to be with her, practically alone,
beyond the sight and hearing of her mother; the
Escobars, he thought, had hopes of such a consummation.
It was useless, he was solely wedded
to Cuba; he had already pictured the only dramatic
accident of the heart that could touch him.
Not little Narcisa! She was turned away from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
him completely: a lovely back, straight and narrow,
virginal&mdash;Domingo Escobar had said this&mdash;as
a white rose bud, yet with an impalpable
and seductive scent. In other circumstances, a
happier and more casual world, she would have
been an adorable fate. An increasing awkwardness
seized him, a conviction of impotence.
&#8220;Narcisa,&#8221; he whispered at her ear; but, before
he could finish his sentence, her face was close to
his, her eyes were shut and the tenderness of her
lips unprotected.</p>
<p>Charles put an arm about her slim shoulders
and pressed his cheek against hers. &#8220;Listen,&#8221;
he went on, in his lowered voice, patching the
deficiencies of his Spanish with English words
clear in their feeling if not in sound, &#8220;nothing
could have shown me myself as well as you, for
now I know that I can never give up a thought
to anything outside what I have promised my
life to. A great many men are quite happy with
a loving wife and children and a home&mdash;a place
to go back to always; and, in a way, since I
have known you, I envy them. Their lives are
full of happiness and usefulness and specially
peace; but, dearest Narcisa, I can&#8217;t be like that,
it isn&#8217;t for me. You see, I have chosen to love
a country; instead of being devoted only to you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
there are thousands of women, rich and poor
and black and white, I must give myself for.
I haven&#8217;t any existence, any rights, of my own;
I haven&#8217;t any money or time or security to offer.
I didn&#8217;t choose it, no, it chose me&mdash;it&#8217;s exactly
as though I had been stopped on the street and
conscripted. A bugle was blown in my ear.
Love, you must realize, is selfish; it would be
selfish to take you on a steamer, for myself, and
go north. If I did that, if I forgot what I have
sworn, I&#8217;d die. I should seem to the world to be
alive, and I&#8217;d walk about and talk and go into
the city on some business or other; but, in reality,
I should be as dead as dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are men like that everywhere, Narcisa,
perhaps the most of life is made up of them.
They look all right and are generally respected;
yet, at some time or other, they killed themselves,
they avoided what they should have met, tried
to save something not worth a thought. I don&#8217;t
doubt a lot never find it out, they think they are
as good as ever&mdash;they don&#8217;t remember how they
once felt. But others discover it, or the people
who love them discover it for them. And that
would happen to me, to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>In reply to all this she whispered that she
loved him. Her arm slipped up across his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
shoulder and the tips of her fingers touched his
left cheek. A momentary dizziness enveloped
him at her immeasurable sweetness: it might be
that she was a part of what he was to find, to
do, in Cuba; and then his emotion perished in
the bareness of his heart to physical passion.
Its place was taken by a deep pride in his aloofness
from the flesh; that alone, he felt, dignified
him, set him above the mischances of self-betrayal.</p>
<p>Charles Abbott kissed her softly and then took
her hands. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t want me, Narcisa,&#8221;
he continued; &#8220;if I failed in this, I should fail
you absolutely. If I were unfaithful now I
could never be faithful to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew her hands sharply away. &#8220;It&#8217;s you
who are young and not I,&#8221; she declared; &#8220;you
talk like a boy, like Andrés. All you want is a
kind of glory, like the gold lace the officers of
Isabella wear. Nothing could be more selfish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; he replied patiently.</p>
<p>Narcisa, he felt, could never grasp what was
such a profound part of his masculine necessity.
Abstractions, the liberty, for example, of an alien
people, would have little weight against her instinct
for the realities in her own heart. Her
emotion was tangible, compared with his it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
deeply reasonable; it moved in the direction of
their immediate good, of the happiness, the fullness,
of their beings; while all his desire, his
hope, was cloudy, of the sky. In the high silver
radiance of his idealism, the warmer green of
earth, the promise of Narcisa&#8217;s delicate charm,
the young desire in his blood, were, he felt, far
away, dim ... below.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The conviction fastened upon him that this
chance realization would determine, where women
were concerned, the whole of his life. But that
space, he reminded himself, short at best, was,
in him, to terminate almost at once. All his
philosophy of resistance, of strength, was built
upon the final dignity of a supreme giving. His
thoughts went back to Narcisa as he sat in La
Clavel&#8217;s room in the St. Louis, watching a hairdresser
skilfully build up the complicated edifice
of the dancer&#8217;s hair. Soon, he grasped, it
would be ready for the camellia placed back of
the lobe of an ear. A towel was pinned about
her naked shoulders, she had on a black fringed
petticoat and dangling slippers of red morocco
leather. La Clavel was faced away from
Charles, but, in the mirror before which she sat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
he could see her features and vivid changing
expressions.</p>
<p>The truth was that, close, he had found her
disconcerting, almost appalling. Climbing the
long stairs at the message that she would see him
in her room, he had surrendered himself to the
romantic devotion which had overwhelmed the
small select circle of his intimates. This had
nothing to do with the admirable sentiment of a
practical all-inclusive love; it was &#230;sthetic rather
than social. They all worshipped La Clavel as
a symbol of beauty, as fortunately unattainable
in a small immediate measure; and, bowing inside
the door of her chamber, he had been positively
abashed at the strange actuality of her charm.</p>
<p>La Clavel was at once more essentially feminine
than any other woman he had encountered
and different from all the rest. A part of the
impression she created was the result of her pallor,
the even unnatural whiteness under the night
of her hair. Her face was white, but her lips&mdash;a
carmine stick lay close at her hands&mdash;were
brutally red. She hurt him, struck savagely at
the idealism of his image; indeed, in the room
permeated with a dry powdered scent, at the
woman redolent of vital flesh, he had been a little
sickened. However, that had gone; and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
watched the supple hands in the crisp coarse mass
of her hair with a sense of adventure lingering
faintly from his earlier youth: he was, in very
correct clothes, holding his hat and stick and
gloves, idling through the toilet of a celebrated
dancer and beauty.</p>
<p>Or, rather, he saw himself objectively, as he
had been say a year ago, at which time his present
situation would have surpassed his most
splendid worldly hopes. It was strange, he
thought, how life granted one by one every desire
... when it was no longer valued: the
fragrance, the tender passion, of Narcisa, the
preference in La Clavel singling him out from a
city for her interest!</p>
<p>She smiled at him over her shoulder, and, in
return, he nodded seriously, busy with a cigarette;
maintaining, in a difficult pass, his complete
air of indifference, of experience. The hairdresser
must have pulled roughly at a strand for,
with a sudden harsh vulgarity, she described
him as a blot on the virginity of his mother; in
an instant every atom of her was charged with
anger. It was, Charles told himself, exactly as
though a shock of dried grass had caught fire;
ignited gun powder rather than blood seemed to
fill her veins.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>Her ill-temper, tempestuous in its course, was
over as quickly as it had flared into being. She
paid the hairdresser from a confusion of silver
and gold on her dressing-table and dismissed
him with a good nature flavored by a native proverb.
Then, bending above a drawer, she
brought out the vivid shawl in which she had
danced. La Clavel folded its dragging brilliancy
squarely along its length, laid it across
her breast, brought the fringed ends under and
up over her arms, crossed them in a swift twist,
and she was wholly, magnificently, clothed.
She sat on the edge of a bed covered with gay
oddments of attire&mdash;fans and slippers with vermilion
heels, lace mantillas, a domino in silver
tissue lined in carnation and a knife with a
narrow blade and holder of silk.</p>
<p>Charles offered her his cigarette case, but she
declined in favor of the long pale cigars Andrés
and he himself affected. With its smoke drifting
bluely across her pallid face, her eyes now
interrogating him, and now withdrawn in
thought, she asked him about Tirso Labrador.
Charles Abbott quickly gathered that his presence
was for that sole purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard all that was said,&#8221; she warned him;
&#8220;and I don&#8217;t want that repeated. Why did he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
try to garotte de Vaca with his hands? There
was more in it than appeared. But all Ceaza
will say is that he was a cursed traitor to the
Crown. Signor American, I like Cuba, they
have been very good to me here; I like you and
your polite friends. But whenever I try to
come closer to you, to leave the stage, as it were,
for the audience, we are kept apart. The Spanish
officers who take up so much of my time
warn me that I must have nothing to do
with disaffected Cubans; the Cubans, when
I reach out my arms to them, are only polite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I know that there has been a rebellion;
but it is stamped out, ended, now; there
are no signs of it in Havana, when I dance the
jota; so why isn&#8217;t everyone sensible and social;
why, if they are victorious, are not Gaspar Arco
de Vaca and Ceaza y Santacilla easier? If, as
it must be, Cuba is subjected, why doesn&#8217;t it ignore
the unpleasant and take what the days and
nights always offer? There can be no longer,
so late in the history of the world, a need
for the old Inquisition, the stabbers Philip commanded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Abbott had an impulse to reply that,
far from being conquered, the spirit of liberty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
in Cuba was higher than ever before; he wanted
to tell her, to cry out, that it was deathless; and
that no horrors of the black past were more appalling
than those practiced now by the Spanish
soldiery. Instead of this he watched a curl of
smoke mount through the height of the room to
a small square window far up on the wall where
it was struck gold by a shaft of sunlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was particularly a friend of yours?&#8221; she
insisted, returning to Tirso. &#8220;You were always
together, watching me dance from your box in the
Tacon Theatre, and eating ices at the El Louvre
or at the Tuileries.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke slowly, indifferently, keeping his
gaze elevated toward the ceiling. &#8220;Tirso Labrador
was a braggard, he was always boasting
about what he could do with his foolish muscles.
What happened to him was unavoidable. We
weren&#8217;t sorry&mdash;a thorough bully. As for the
others, that dandy, Quintara, and Remigio
Florez, who looks like a coffee berry from their
plantation at Vuelta Arriba, and Escobar, I am
very much in their debt&mdash;I bring the gold and
they provide the pleasures of Havana. They are
my runners. I haven&#8217;t the slightest interest in
their politics; if they support the Revolution or
Madrid, they keep all that out of my knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>A prolonged silence followed, a period devoted
to the two cigars. &#8220;That Escobar,&#8221; La
Clavel said, &#8220;is a very beautiful boy. What
you tell me is surprising; he, at any rate, seems
quite different. And I have seen you time after
time sitting together, the two or three or four of
you, with affectionate glances and arms. I am
sensitive to such things, and I think you are lying.&#8221;</p>
<p>An air of amused surprise appeared on his
countenance, &#8220;If you are so taken with Andrés
Escobar,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;why did you make this
appointment with me? May I have the pleasure
of taking him a note from you? he is very
fond of intrigues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaning forward she laid a firm square palm
on his knee. &#8220;You have told me all that I
wanted&mdash;this Tirso, who was killed, he was your
dear friend and his death an agony; the smaller,
the coffee berry, you are devoted to his goodness
and simplicity; beneath Quintara&#8217;s waistcoats
you find a heart of gold. But Escobar&mdash;is it
Andrés?&mdash;you love better than your life. They
care nothing for your American dollars; it is
evident they all have much more than you.
What is it, then, you are united by? I shall tell
you&mdash;Cuba. You are patriots, insurrectionists;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
Santacilla was right. And neither is your rebellion
crushed, not with Agramonte alive.&#8221; She
leaned back with glimmering eyes and the cruel
paint of her mouth smiling at him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>She was, then, Charles Abbott reflected, an
agent of Spain&#8217;s; calmly he rehearsed all they
had said to each other, he examined every sentence,
every inflection of voice. He could not
have been more circumspect; the position he had
taken, of a pleasure-loving young American, was
so natural that it was inevitable. No, La Clavel
knew nothing, she was simply adopting another
method in her task of getting information for
Santacilla. At this, remembering the adoration
of his circle for her, he was brushed by a swift
sorrow. For them she had been the symbol, the
embodiment, of beauty; the fire and grace of her
dancing had intensified, made richer, their sense
of life. She had been the utmost flashing peak
of their desire; and now it was clear to him that
she was rotten at the core, La Clavel was merely
a spy; what had engaged them was nothing more
than a brilliant flowery surface, a bright shawl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are wasting your efforts,&#8221; he assured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
her, with an appearance of complete comfort.
&#8220;Even if you were right, I mean about the others,
what, do you think, would make them confide in
me, almost a stranger? You understand this so
much better than I that, instead of questioning
me, you ought to explain the whole Cuban situation.
Women like yourself, with genius, know
everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>She utterly disconcerted Charles by enveloping
him in a rapid gesture, her odorous lips were
pressed against his cheek. &#8220;You are as sweet as
a lime flower,&#8221; La Clavel declared. &#8220;After the
others&mdash;&#8221; her expression of disgust was singularly
valid. &#8220;That is what I love about you,&#8221;
she cried suddenly, &#8220;your youth and freshness
and courage. Tirso Labrador dying so gallantly
... all your beardless intent faces. The revolt
in Cuba, I&#8217;ve felt it ever since I landed at
Havana, it&#8217;s in the air like wine. I am sick of
officers: look, ever since I was a child the army
has forced itself upon me. I had to have their
patronage when I was dancing and their company
when I went to the cafés; and when it wasn&#8217;t the
cavalry it was the gentlemen. They were always
superior, condescending; and always, inside me,
I hated them. They thought, because I was
peasant born, that their attentions filled me with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
joy, that I should be grateful for their aristocratic
presences. But, because I was what I was,
I held them, with their ladies&#8217; hands and sugared
voices, in contempt. There isn&#8217;t one of them
with the entrails to demand my love.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I was smothering in the air about
me. My dancing isn&#8217;t like the posturing of the
court, it&#8217;s the dancing of the people, my people,
passionate like a knife. I am from the Morena,
and there we are not the human sheep who
live in the valleys, along the empty rivers. How
shall I explain? But how can you explain yourself?
You are not a Cuban; this rebellion, in
which you may so easily be killed almost before
you begin to live, it isn&#8217;t yours. What drew you
into it? You must make it plain, for I, too, am
caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Men are different from women,&#8221; he replied,
putting into words his newly acquired wisdom;
&#8220;whatever happened to me would be useless for
you, you couldn&#8217;t be helped by it.&#8221; Yet he was
forced to admit to himself that all she had said
was reasonable; at bottom it didn&#8217;t contradict his
generalization, for it was based on a reality, on
La Clavel&#8217;s long resentment, on indignities to her
pride, on, as she had said, the innate freedom of
the mountain spirit. If she were honest, any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
possible attachment to Cuba might result from
her hatred of Spain, of Sevilla and Madrid.
Hers, then, would be the motive of revenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right about the difference in our experiences,&#8221;
she agreed; &#8220;I was dancing for a
living at six; at ten I had another accomplishment.
I have lived in rooms inlaid with gold,
and in cellars with men where murder would
have been a gracious virtue. Yes, lime flower,
there is little you know that could be any assistance
to me. But the other, your purity, your
effort of nobility, that I must learn from
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He explained his meaning more fully to her,
and she listened intently. &#8220;You think,&#8221; she interrupted,
&#8220;that a woman must be attached to
something real, like your arm or a pot of gold.
You know them, and that at your age, at any age,
is a marvel enough in itself. The wisest men in
Europe have tried to understand the first movement
of my dancing&mdash;how, in it, a race, the
whole history of a nation, is expressed in the
stamp of a heel, the turn of a hip. They wonder
what, in me, had happened to the maternal
instinct, why I chose to reflect life, as though I
were a mirror, rather than experience it. And
now, it seems, you see everything, all is clear to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
you. You have put a label, such as are in museums,
on women; good!&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled at him, mocking but not unkind.</p>
<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; he told her crossly, &#8220;that is of
very little importance. How did we begin? I
have forgotten already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In this way,&#8221; she said coolly; &#8220;I asked if
it would be of any interest to&mdash;let us say, your
friends, to learn that the United States, in spite
of the Administration, will not recognize a Republican
Cuba. Fish is unchangeably opposed to
the insurgents. You may expect no help there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That might be important to the insurgents,&#8221;
he admitted; &#8220;but where are they to be found&mdash;in
the cabildos of Los Egidos?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At least repeat what you have heard to Escobar:
is it Andrés or Vincente?&#8221;</p>
<p>The name of Andrés&#8217; brother was spoken so
unexpectedly, the faintest knowledge of Vincente
on the part of the dancer of such grave importance,
that Charles Abbott momentarily lost his
composure. &#8220;Vincente!&#8221; he exclaimed awkwardly.
&#8220;Was that the other brother? But he
is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;It is planned for
tonight, after dinner, when he is smoking in the
little upper salon.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>Agitated, at a loss for further protest, he rose.
He must go at once to the Escobars, warn them.
&#8220;You will admit now that I have been of use,&#8221;
La Clavel was standing beside him. &#8220;And it is
possible, if Vincente Escobar isn&#8217;t found, and
Ceaza discovers that you were here, that&mdash;&#8221; she
paused significantly. &#8220;I am the victim of a
madness,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;of a Cuban fever.&#8221;
But there was no time now to analyse the processes
of her mind and sex.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be going,&#8221; he said abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; she returned; &#8220;but what about
your coming back? That will be more difficult,
and yet it is necessary. Ah, yes, you must pretend
to be in love with me; it will be hard, but
what else is there? A dancer has always a number
of youths at her loose heels.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be laughed at, of course; the officers,
Santacilla and Gaspar, will be unbearable. You
will have to play the infatuated fool, and send
me bouquets of gardenias and three-cornered
notes, and give me money. That won&#8217;t be so
hard, because we can use the same sum over and
over; but I shall have to read the notes to my
protectors in the army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be going,&#8221; he repeated, gathering his
stick and gloves from the floor. She asked, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
a breath of wistfulness, if he could manage a
touch of affection for her? Charles Abbott replied
that this was not the hour for such questions.
&#8220;The young,&#8221; she sighed, &#8220;are glacial.&#8221;
But that, she proceeded, was exactly what drew
her to them. They were like the pure wind along
the eaves under which she had been born. &#8220;I
promise never to kiss you again, or, if I must,
solely as the mark of brotherhood. And now go
back to&mdash;to Andrés.&#8221;</p>
<p>She backed away from him, superb in the
shawl, and again she was rayed in the superlative
beauty of her first appearance. The woman
was lost in the dancer, the flesh in the vision,
the art.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could be a goddess,&#8221; Charles told her,
&#8220;the shrine of thousands of hearts.&#8221; The declaration
of his entire secret was on his lips;
but, after all, it wasn&#8217;t his. There was a
possibility that she had lied about Vincente,
and at this second he might be dead, the
Volunteers waiting for him, Charles Abbott,
below.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Hurrying through the Paseo Isabel to the
Prado, Charles, looking at his watch, found that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
it was nearly six. Carmita Escobar and Narcisa,
and probably Domingo, were driving perhaps
by the sea or perhaps toward Los Molinos,
the park of the Captain-General. At any rate
the women would be away from the house, and
that, in the situation which faced the Escobars,
was fortunate. If what La Clavel said were
true, and Charles Abbott now believed her implicitly,
the agents of the Crown would be already
watching in the Prado. Vincente must be smuggled
away; how, he didn&#8217;t yet see; but a consultation
would result in a plan for his escape.
The servant who opened the small door in the
great iron-studded double gate, though he knew
Charles Abbott well, was uncommunicative to
the point of rudeness. He refused to say who
of the family were at home; he intimated that,
in any case, Charles would not be seen, and he
attempted to close him out.</p>
<p>Charles, however, ignoring the other&#8217;s protests,
forced his way into the arch on the patio.
He went up the wide stairs unceremoniously to
the suite of formal rooms along the street, where,
to his amazement, he found the Escobar family
seated in the sombreness of drawn curtains, and
all of them with their faces marked with tears.
Surprised by his abrupt appearance they showed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
no emotion other than a dull indifference. Then
Andrés rose and put his hand on Charles&#8217; shoulder,
speaking in a level grave voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Abbott, Vincente, our brother, has
made the last sacrifice possible to men. He died
at noon, sitting in his chair, as a result of the
fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was tragic, but, with a deeper knowledge
of the dilemma facing them, Charles was actually
impatient. &#8220;What,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;are you
going to do with the body?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is placed in dignity on a couch, and we
have sent to Matanzas for a priest we can trust.
He&#8217;ll be here early in the morning, and then, and
then, we must forget our love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must do that now, without a minute&#8217;s
loss,&#8221; Charles urged them. &#8220;You can wait for
no priest. The Spanish Government knows he
is here; tonight, after dinner, he was to have
been taken. The house will be stood on its roof,
every inch investigated. You spoke, once, of
Narcisa, what might horribly swallow you all.
Well, it has almost come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrés&#8217; grip tightened; he was pale but quiet.
&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he asserted; &#8220;but how did you
find this out, and save us?&#8221; That, Charles replied,
was of no importance now. What could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
they do with Vincente&#8217;s body? Carmita, his
mother, began to cry again, noiselessly; Narcisa,
as frigid as a statue in marble, sat with her wide
gaze fastened on Charles Abbott. &#8220;What?&#8221;
Domingo echoed desperately. It was no longer
a question of the dignity, the blessing, of the
dead, but of the salvation of the living. Vincente&#8217;s
corpse, revered a few minutes before, now
became a hideous menace; it seemed to have
grown to monumental proportions, a thing impossible
to put out of sight.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly soldiers were watching, guarding
the house: a number of men in nondescript
clothes were lounging persistently under the rows
of Indian laurels below. A hundred practical
objections immediately rose to confront every proposal.
Carmita and Narcisa had been sent from
the room, and a discussion was in progress of
the possibility of cutting the body into minute
fragments. &#8220;If that is decided on,&#8221; Domingo
Escobar declared, with sweat rolling over his forehead,
&#8220;I must do it; my darling and heroic son
would approve; he would wish me to be his
butcher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrés, harder, more mature, than the elder,
stopped such expressions of sentiment. It would
make such a mess, he reminded them; and then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
how far could the servants, the hysterical negroes,
be depended upon? They would soon
discover the progress of such an operation.</p>
<p>Charles suggested fire, but the Spanish stoves,
with shallow cups for charcoal, were useless, and
the ovens were cold; it would create suspicion to
set them to burning so late in the day. &#8220;Since
we can&#8217;t get rid of it,&#8221; Charles declared, &#8220;we
must accept it. The body is there, but whose is
it? Did you send a servant to Matanzas?&#8221;</p>
<p>Two had gone, riding, once they were beyond
Havana, furiously. A Jamaican negro, huge
and black, totally unlike Vincente, and a Cuban
newly in the city, a mestizo, brought in from the
Escobars&#8217; small sugar estate near Madriga.
Andrés at once appropriated Charles&#8217; idea.
Their mother and Narcisa, he proclaimed, must
go out as usual for their afternoon drive, and he
would secure some clothes that belonged to Juan
Roman, the servant. No one in the back of the
house, luckily, had seen the riders leave. Judged
more faithful than the rest, they had been sent
away as secretly as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; Charles Abbott asked, &#8220;caused his
death?&#8221; Andrés faced him coldly. &#8220;This pig
of a countryman I killed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
Spanish will understand that. They have killed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
a multitude of us, for nothing, for neglect in polishing
the back of a boot. It will be more difficult
with the servants,&mdash;they are used to kindness,
consideration, here; but they, too, in other
places, have had their lesson. And I was
drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of Charles&#8217; insistence, he was not permitted
to assist in the carrying out of the details
that followed. He sat, walked about, alone in
the drawing-room. After an interminable wait
he heard the report, faint and muffled by walls,
of a pistol, and then running feet passed the
door. Domingo appeared first, a glass of
brandy in his shaking hand:</p>
<p>&#8220;He has gone, in a sack, to be thrown into
the sea ... the blood hid his face. Ah, Jesu!
But it was successful&mdash;a corporal looked, with
the hundred doblons I pressed into his hand.
He kicked the body three times, thrust a knife
into it, and said that there, anyhow, was one less
Cuban.&#8221; Andrés entered the room and, without
speech, embraced Charles, kissing him on either
cheek; and soon Carmita Escobar and Narcisa,
with their parasols and embroidered gloves, returned
from their drive.</p>
<p>They could do nothing but wait for what impended,
and Charles Abbott related to Andrés
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
the entire scene with La Clavel. &#8220;I believe in
her,&#8221; he concluded. Andrés agreed with him.
&#8220;Her plan is excellent,&#8221; he pronounced; &#8220;it will
be very hard on you, though. You will be fed
on insults.&#8221; That, Charles protested, was nothing.
&#8220;And, worse still, it will end our companionship.
You will be able no longer to go about
with Jaime and Remigio and me. Yes, that, so
soon, is over. What was left of our happiness
together has been taken away. We are nothing
now in ourselves. How quickly, Charles, we
have aged; when I look in the glass I half expect
to see grey hair. It is sad, this. Why did
you leave your comfort and safety and come to
us? But, thank God, you did. It was you who
saved us for the present. And that, now, is
enough; you must go back to the San Felipe.
Put on your best clothes, with a rose in your buttonhole,
and get drunk in all the cafés; tell anyone
who will listen that La Clavel is more superb
than Helen of the Greeks, and buy every
Spanish officer you see what he may fancy.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Charles Abbott left the Escobar dwelling
a detachment of Cuban Volunteers on horse, and
a file of infantry, their uniform of brown drilling
dressed with red collars and cuffs, had gathered
across its face. &#8220;Quien vive?&#8221; a harsh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
voice stopped him. &#8220;Forastero,&#8221; Charles answered
sullenly. He was subjected to a long insolent
scrutiny, a whangee cane smote him
sharply across the back. He regarded the men
about him stolidly; while an officer, who had
some English, advised him to keep away from
suspected Cubans. But, at last, he was released,
directed to proceed at once to Anche del Norte
Street, where his passport would be again examined.
Charles prepared slowly for dinner at
the Dominica; and, when he was ready to go out,
he was the pattern of a fashionable and idle
young tourist. But what filled his mind was the
speculation whether or not the Escobars would
remember to prevent the return of Juan Roman
with the priest from Matanzas.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Nothing, considering the aspirations of Charles
Abbott, could have been more ironical than the
phase of life he entered upon the acceptance of
La Clavel into the party of independence. The
entire success of this dangerous arrangement depended
on his ability to create an impression,
where he was concerned, of unrelieved vapidity.
He was supposed to be infatuated with the dancer;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
and he lingered, not wholly sober, about the fashionable
resorts. Charles sent her flowers; and,
sitting in his room on the roof of the San Felipe,
he composed, in a cold distaste, innumerable
short variations on the theme of a fluid and
fatuous attachment. In reality, he had been repelled
by the actuality of La Clavel; he had an
unconquerable aversion for her room with its
tumbled vivid finery, the powdered scents mingling
with the odors of her body and of the brandy
always standing in a glass beside her. Yet the
discrepancy between the woman herself and the
vision she had bred continued to puzzle and
disconcert him.</p>
<p>When they were together it was this he preferred
to talk about. At times she answered his
questioning with a like interest; but all, practically,
that she understood about herself, her
dancing, had been expressed in their first conversation
upon that topic. The rest, at best, was
no more than a childlike curiosity and vanity.
She had an insatiable appetite for compliment;
and, sincere in his admiration for her impersonal
aspect, Charles was content to gratify her; except
when, in spite of her promise, she kissed
him ardently. This never failed to seriously
annoy him; and afterwards she would offer him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
a mock apology. It detracted, he felt, from his
dignity, assaulted, insidiously, the elevation of
his purpose in life.</p>
<p>He cherished a dislike, part cultivated and part
subconscious, for women. All his thoughts and
emotions were celibate, chaste. Such a scene had
just ended, La Clavel was at her glass, busy with
a rouge pot and a scrap of soft leather; and
Charles was standing stiffly by the door. She
had used, in describing him, a Spanish word
about the meaning of which he was not quite
clear, but he had an idea that it bore a close resemblance
to prig. That specially upset him.
At the moment his dislike for her almost broke
down his necessary diplomacy. In an island of
men desirous of her least favor&mdash;her fame transcended
seas and reached from coast to coast&mdash;he
only, thinking less than nothing of his privilege,
had an instant unchallenged access to her.</p>
<p>He knew, carefully watched, all her various
dependents: Calixto Sola, the hairdresser, a creature
with a sterile face constantly twisted into
painful grimaces; he was an employee in a barbering
shop on Neptune Street, too volatile for
any convictions, but because of a spiteful, injured
disposition, not to be trusted. Then there
was La Clavel&#8217;s maid, Jobaba, a girl with an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
alabaster beauty indefinitely tainted by Africa.
She was, Charles decided, the most corrupt
being he had ever encountered. Her life away
from the St. Louis was incredibly, wildly, debauched.
Among other things, she danced, as
the mulata, the rumba, an indescribable affair;
and she had connections with the rites of brujeria,
the degraded black magic of the Carabale
in Cuba. She was beautiful, with a perfection
of grace, except for the direct gaze of her brown
eyes, which revealed an opacity, a dullness, like
mud. She was, even more than to La Clavel,
the servant of Santacilla; she reported, the dancer
told Charles, every possible act and speech
of her mistress to the Spaniards, who, in return,
supplied her with a little money and a load of
biting curses.</p>
<p>The chambermaid who attended La Clavel&#8217;s
room had lost a lover with the forces of General
Agramonte, and was of use to Charles; without
knowledge of the hidden actuality she yet
brought him, unread, communications for the
patriotic party; and she warned him of Santacilla&#8217;s
presence and uncertain humors. The
laundress had been, in her youth, an actress in
the cheap local theatres, and, when she was
not sodden with drink, showed an admirable devotion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
to her famous patron by the most delicate
feats imaginable in ironing. She was almost
purely Spanish and had only a contempt for the
Cubeños.</p>
<p>While Charles Abbott&#8217;s duty was, on the surface,
direct and easy, it was complicated by the
need for a constant watchfulness, a wit in countless
small details. Supporting, well enough, the
boredom of his public role, he had to manage with
an unfailing dexterity the transmission of the
information that came to the insurrectionists
through La Clavel. These facts she gathered
through the unguarded moments of Ceaza y Santacilla&#8217;s
talk&mdash;he was close to the Captain-General
and had important connections at Madrid&mdash;and,
at prolonged parties, from the conversation
of his intimates. Charles put these communications
into contracted written English sentences;
in that way, even as against the accidental
chance of being, at any time, searched, he could
better convey their import; and gave them in
carefully planned, apparently incidental encounters,
to any one of a score of correctly gloved and
boutonnièred young men he had come to know by
adroitly managed assurances.</p>
<p>Charles had formed, as well, principally in
the Café Dominica, a superficial familiarity with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
other Americans in Havana for banking or commercial
purposes. They, regarding him as immensely
rich and dissipated, were half contemptuous
and half eager for the associations, the
pleasures, of his mode of life. He went, as
often as it seemed necessary, to the United States
Club on Virtudes Street, where, together with
his patriots, but different from them in a hidden
contempt, he gambled, moderately and successfully.
His luck became proverbial, and, coupled
with La <ins title="Was Cavel's">Clavel&#8217;s</ins> name, his reputation soon grew
into what he intrigued for. Often, alone on the
hotel roof, he regarded himself with an objective
amazement: everything was precisely as he had
planned, hoped for, on the steamer Morro
Castle&mdash;and entirely different.</p>
<p>It was probable that the death he had
not, in imagination, shrunk from, would crush
him at any unexpected moment, an unpredictable
slip; but how could he have foreseen the
trivial guise he would wear? Charles was
forced, it seemed to him, to ape every single
quality he hated. The spending of his money,
as legitimately as though it were exchanged for
guns, on casual acquaintances and rum punches,
on gardenias that wilted and entertainment that
choked him by its vulgar banality, gradually embittered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
him. The insincerity of the compliments
he paid, the lying compliments to which he listened
with an ingenuous smile and an entire comprehension
of their worthlessness, steadily robbed
his ideal of its radiant aloofness.</p>
<p>His enthusiasm, he discovered, his high ardor,
must be changed to patience and fortitude, the
qualities which belonged to his temperament and
years had to give place to those of an accomplished
maturity; the romance of his circumstance
deserted the surface to linger hidden, cherished,
beneath all the practical and immediate rest. He
began to perceive the inescapable disappointing
difference between an idea, a conception of the
mind, and its execution. The realization of that,
he told himself, the seduction of the lofty, the
aerial, to earth, constituted success, power. The
spirit and the flesh! And the flesh constantly
betrayed the highest determinations. How he
resented, distrusted, the mechanics, the traps and
illusions, of an existence on an animal plane!</p>
<p>His fervor, turned in upon itself, began to assume
an aspect of the religious; his imposed revolt
from the mundane world turned his thoughts
to an intangible heaven, a spotless and immaterial
hereafter. The white façades of Havana, intolerably
gold under the sun and glimmering in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
the tropical nights, the procession and clamor of
the Dia des Reyes, the crowded theatres, the restaurants
where, with no appetite, he ate as little
as possible&mdash;began to appear vague, unsubstantial.
What, so intently, was on every hand
being done he thought meaningless. Where, originally,
he had been absorbed in bringing relief
to countless specific Cubans, he now only dwelt
on a possible tranquility of souls, a state, like
that promised in the Bible, without corruption
and injustice and tears.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>These considerations particularly occupied
Charles Abbott waiting inside the door of Santa
Clara Church for La Clavel, who was coming
to the eight o&#8217;clock morning mass. Outside, the
day was still and very hot, intolerably blazing,
but the darkened interior of the church, the air
heavy with incense, was cool. An intermittent
stream of people entered&mdash;the white and gilt of
a Spanish naval uniform was followed by gay
silks, a priest passed noiselessly, like a shadow;
an old woman with a rippling fire of jewels made
her way forward, across the wide stone floor, with
the regular subdued tap of a cane. The impending
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
celebration of the mass gathered its activity,
its white and black figures, about an altar.
Suddenly Charles envied the priests in their service
of an ideal embodied in a spiritual Trinity.
Even Cuba vanished from the foreground of his
thoughts at the conception of a devotion not alone
to an island, a nation, but to all the world of
men. His interest, measured with this, was
merely temporal, limited.</p>
<p>Compared with the Protestant influences of his
birth and experience, the separation of religion
from society, the all-absorbing gesture and the
mysticism of the Roman church offered a complete
escape, an obliteration, of the individual.
But, as he dwelt upon this, he realized that, for
him, it was an impossibility. He might be a
Franciscan, begging his way, in brown bagging
and sandals, through a callous world for which
he ceaselessly prayed; or one of the heroic Jesuits
of the early French occupation of the Mississippi
Valley. Yet these, as well, were no more than
pictures, designs in a kaleidoscope which, immediately
turned, would be destroyed in a fresh
pattern. He was brought back to reality by the
swinging of the heavy curtain at the door; a segment
of day, like a white explosion of powder,
was visible, and La Clavel proceeded to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
font of holy water. As he joined her she complained:</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have held it for me in your palm;
what barbarians the Americans and English are.&#8221;
She was, characteristically, dressed as brightly
as possible, in a mauve skirt with an elaborately
cut flounce swaying about yellow silk stockings,
a mantón of white crêpe de Chine embroidered
with immense emerald green blossoms; her hair
piled about its tall comb was covered with a mantilla
falling in scallops across her brilliant cheeks.
In the church, that reduced so much, she was startling
in her bold color and presence.</p>
<p>A negro, whom Charles recognized as a servant
at the St. Louis, followed her with a heavy
roll and a small unpainted chair with a caned
seat. Before the altar, under the low pointed
arches of the transept, he spread out a deep-piled
Persian rug&mdash;where La Clavel promptly kneeled&mdash;and
set the chair conveniently for her. Her
devotion at an end, the dancer rose and disposed
herself comfortably. The constant flutter of a
fan with sandal wood sticks stirred the edge of
her mantilla. After she had scrutinized the
worshippers about them, she turned to Charles,
speaking in a guarded voice.</p>
<p>He listened with an intense concentration, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
the careful preliminaries of a difficult act of memory,
asking her, when it could not be avoided, to
repeat facts or names. They were, now, concerned
with the New York Junta, involved tables
of costs, and La Clavel was palpably annoyed
by the unaccustomed necessity of a strict mental
effort. She raised her eyebrows, shot an inviting
glance at an interested man of middle age, and
shut and opened her fan by an irritable twist of
the wrist. Watching, weighing, her mood,
Charles abruptly brought her recital to an end.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is enough for the present,&#8221; he decided.</p>
<p>&#8220;My choice infant,&#8221; she retorted, &#8220;your air of
being my director is comic. And I could wish
you were not so immaculate, so unworldly&mdash;you
are tiresome more often than not. I could scream
with laughing when I think you are supposed to
be my servant of love.&#8221; The striking of a silvery
bell interrupted her with the necessity for
a reverence. The mutter of prayer was instantly
lost in echoless space. The genuflexions of the
priests and acolytes were rapid. &#8220;This secrecy,&#8221;
she went on, &#8220;is against my disposition,
unnatural. I am a woman in whom the complete
expression of every feeling is not only a
good but a necessity. There are times when I
must, it seems, give way to my hatred of those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
perfumed captains. I sit beside Santacilla, with
his hand on my knee, and, hidden by my skirt,
my fingers are wedded to the knife in my stocking.
A turn, a sweep of the arm ... there is
a tearing cut I learned in the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prayers, the Latin invocations, grew
louder with the symbolized miracle of transubstantiation,
the turning back of the bread and
wine into the humility and forbearance of Christ.</p>
<p>Charles Abbott was still, pale and remote; and
the heat of La Clavel&#8217;s words died before the
vision of an eternal empire of souls irrevocably
judged. She sank forward again, the knotted
fringe of her mantón spread out beyond the rug,
upon the stone. After a little he told her that her
courage, her daring and patience, were magnificent.
But she replied that they were cold virtues.
&#8220;All virtues are cold,&#8221; Charles assured
her seriously. If that were so, La Clavel whispered,
her cheek close to his, she was lost to virtue.
Anyhow, she didn&#8217;t believe him, he could
not, at his age, know so much. Yet not, God
comprehended, that he wasn&#8217;t both virtuous and
cold; any other man in the world, not a heathen,
would have flung himself at her. Charles said
wearily:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been over this before, and you know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
that I do not care for women. What I was a
few years ago&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A baby,&#8221; she informed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I was a few years ago,&#8221; he repeated
with dignity, &#8220;is no longer true of me. I belong
body and spirit to the cause of which you are
aware. And if I didn&#8217;t it would be, in many
respects, no different&mdash;science and the liberation
of a people are all one, selfless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I left the knife out of my present toilet,&#8221; she
sighed. &#8220;It would be a charity to free you from
the shape you hate so dearly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go back to the San Felipe and write
what you told me,&#8221; he proceeded. &#8220;I understand
that Santacilla has gone out on a slaughtering
party, and I&#8217;ll have to take you around in the
evening. There are zarzuelas in the Tacon
Theatre this evening, and afterwards, I suppose,
dulces upstairs at the Tuileries. It&#8217;s no good,
though, expecting me for Retreta&mdash;I&#8217;ve got to
have some time to recover and sleep: four o&#8217;clock
last night, with a pack of imbeciles, and three the
night before. The smell of Jamaica rum and
limes makes me sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mass was over, the people scattering, and,
once more cheerful, she laughed at him. &#8220;You
might wear a hair shirt,&#8221; she suggested; &#8220;they are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
splendid for the soul.&#8221; He handed her, without
reply, into the small victoria, one of the first in
Havana, which had taken the place of her volanta.
In the sun, her shawl, her smile, were
dazzling. A knot of men gathered, gazing at
her with longing, regarding Charles Abbott with
insolent resentment and wonder; how, their expressions
made clear the thought, could that insignificant
and colorless foreigner, that tepid
American, engage and hold La Clavel, the glory
of Cuba and Spain?</p>
<p>She drove away, shielding her eyes with the
fan, and Charles returned slowly, on foot, to the
hotel, reaching it in time for the eleven o&#8217;clock
breakfast. Bolting his door, closing the high
shutters of his glassless window, he lay down
tired and feverish. The vendors of oranges
cried, far off, their naranjes, naranjes dulces.
The bed, which had no mattress, its sacking covered
by a single sheet, the pillow stuffed hard with
cotton, offered him little rest. His body, wet
with sweat, twisted and turned continually, and
sleep evaded him; its peace almost within his
grasp, it fled before the hot insistence of his
thoughts. The uncomfortable flesh mocked and
dragged at the spirit. It occurred to him suddenly,
devastatingly, that he might fail in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
purpose; the armor of his conviction of invincibility
fell from him with the semblance of a loud
ringing.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Of all the disturbing elements in Charles
Abbott&#8217;s present life the one which, it had seemed,
must prove most difficult, Santacilla and his
friends, troubled him least. There was, in their
jeering, a positive quality to be met; his own necessary
restraint furnished him with a sustaining
feeling of triumph, stability; in his control, the
sacrifice of his dignity, his actual pride, damaged
by La Clavel, was restored. He acted the part
of the infatuated, ubiquitous youth, he thought,
with entire success. It had been hardest at first&mdash;Santacilla,
who pretended to find Charles under
his feet like a dog, threatened, if he didn&#8217;t stay
away from the St. Louis, to fling him down the
long flight of stairs descending from the dancer&#8217;s
room.</p>
<p>This, Charles wholly realized, was not an idle
boasting. Seated, it might be, quietly against
the wall, outside the immediate circle about La
Clavel, the officers, the Spanish grandees in Cuba
for pleasure or for the supervision of their copper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
mines at Cobra, Charles would watch, study,
Ceaza y Santacilla, finding in him the epitome
of the Spain he himself hated. What, principally,
was evident about the officer with the heavy
short neck, the surprising red hair, and small
restless blue eyes, was cruelty of an extraordinary
refined persistence. He had, unexpectedly
in his sheer brutal bulk, a tormenting spirit,
a mental abnormality, rather than the to-be-looked-for
mere insensate weight of his fist. He
was, Charles discovered, the victim of disordered
nerves, his gaze, his thick hands or shoulders,
were never still, and his lips had a trick of movement
as if in the pronunciation of soundless periods.</p>
<p>He spoke, even to La Clavel, abruptly, mockingly;
his tenderest words, addressed to her with
a sweeping disregard of whoever could overhear,
were hasty, introspective rather than generous.
More frequently he was silent, redly brooding.
It was evident to the most casual understanding
that Santacilla was, by birth, association and
ideas, an aristocrat of the absolute type fast disappearing.
It was his power that, in a world
largely affected by the ideal of Christianity, he
was ruthless; in an era of comparative humanity
he was inhuman. There was, about him, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
smell of the slow fires of the Inquisition, of languid
murder, curious instruments of pain.
Charles recalled a story of the Spanish occupation
of Cuba&mdash;how the soldiers in armor cut and
stabbed their way through a village of naked, unprepared
and peaceable bodies.</p>
<p>That, until he had known Santacilla, had been
incomprehensible&mdash;a page of old history; but
now Charles understood: he could see the heavy
figure with a darkly suffused face hacking with
a sword. He was insane, Charles Abbott told
himself; in other circumstances he&#8217;d be soon convicted
of a sensational murder, quickly hanged or
put in an asylum. But in Havana, as an officer
of the Crown quartered on a people he held in
less esteem than the cattle whose slaughter he
applauded in the bull ring, nothing, practically,
limited his mad humors. Yes, here, in the
West, he was Spain, the old insufferable despotism,
and Charles thought of Santacilla&#8217;s necessary
end as coldly as though the soldier were no
more than a figment of the doomed old injustice.</p>
<p>La Clavel was seated with Charles Abbott in
the upper room of the Tuileries, when Santacilla
slid into an unoccupied chair beside them. They
were eating mantecados, frozen sweetened cream,
and Santacilla dropped a number of battered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
Cuban coins, small in denomination, into Charles&#8217;
half consumed ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were a man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you could
break them up with your teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other quietly put the plate away and
lighted a cigarette. He smiled, as if in appreciation
of his humor, at the officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll bet you twenty doblons you can&#8217;t break
one,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Santacilla replied that he was considering
having Charles Abbott deported.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so dangerous,&#8221; he explained, with
the grimace that served him as a smile. &#8220;I
often consult with our Captain-General. &#8216;This
Abbott,&#8217; he says; &#8216;Agramonte is nothing, but I
am afraid of him. He is wise, he is deep.&#8217; And
then we think what can be done with you&mdash;a tap
on the head, not too hard and not far from the
ear, would make you as gentle as a kitten. I
have had it done; really it is a favor, since then
you would forget all your trouble, the problems
of state. You&#8217;d cry if I raised a finger at you.&#8221;
La Clavel interrupted him to swear at his degraded
imagination. &#8220;And the figure in the
jota!&#8221; he turned to her. &#8220;You know that the
Spaniards of birth have, as well as their own,
the blood of the Moriscos. What they were,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
what the East is, with women, I beg you to remember.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new treatment of women is very regrettable.
I am a little late for absolute happiness;
too late, for example, to fasten your tongue with
a copper wire to the tongue across the table from
you. Lovers, you see, joined at last.&#8221; He
talked while he ate, in a manner wholly delicate,
minute fragile dulces, cakes, glazed in green and
pink, and ornamental confections of almond
paste. Unperturbed, La <ins title="Was Cavel">Clavel</ins> found him comparable
to a number of appalling objects and
states. Coarse, was all that he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a peasant, a beast, and what you say
is merely stupid. There this Abbott is your superior&mdash;he
has a trace, a suspicion, of blood. I
am wondering,&#8221; he was addressing Charles again.
&#8220;It seems impossible that you are as dull as you
appear; there is more, perhaps, than meets the
eye. Your friendship with the Escobars broke
up very suddenly; and you never see Floret and
Quintara with his borrowed French airs. They
are nothing, it is true, yet they have a little Castilian,
they are better than the avaricious fools at
the United States Club. Of course, if you are in
love with this cow gone mad, a great deal is accounted
for.&#8221; He wiped his fingers first on a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
serviette and then on a sheer web of linen marked
with a coronet and his cipher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pah!&#8221; he exclaimed, looking at the dancer,
&#8220;your neck is dirty again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sick with disgust, his blood racing with a passionate
detestation, Charles Abbott laughed
loudly. But he was relieved that Santacilla&#8217;s
attention had been shifted from him. Another
officer, a major of the Isabel regiment, tall and
dark and melancholy, joined them. He ignored
Charles completely, and talked to La Clavel about
her dances&mdash;the Arragonese jota and those of the
other provinces of Spain. He had, it developed,
written an opera on the subject of de Gama and
a fabulous Florida. Santacilla grew restive at
this and gazed about the room maliciously.
Then, suddenly, he rose and walked to the table
where a young Cuban exquisite was sitting with
a girl slender and darkly lovely. Santacilla
leaned over, with his hands planted on their
table, and made a remark that drove the blood in
a scarlet tide to the civilian&#8217;s face. Then the
Spaniard amazingly produced from his sleeve a
ball of lamb&#8217;s wool such as women use to powder
their faces, and touched the girl&#8217;s nose lightly.
He went to another table and repeated his act,
to another and another, brushing all the feminine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
noses, and returned, unchallenged, to his
place.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had been with any of those women,&#8221; he
related comfortably, &#8220;and the King had done that,
there would have been a new king and a new
infanta.&#8221;</p>
<p>The musical Spaniard, inappropriately in uniform,
remonstrated, &#8220;A lot of them will kill you
some night in the Paseo de Valdez or on the
quays.&#8221;</p>
<p>Santacilla agreed with him. &#8220;No doubt it
will overtake me&mdash;if not here, then on the Peninsula.
A hundred deaths, all distressing, have
been sworn upon me.&#8221; Charles Abbott&#8217;s expression
was inane, but, correcting that statement,
he said to himself, &#8220;A hundred and one.&#8221;</p>
<p>La Clavel yawned, opening to their fullest extent
her lips on superb teeth and a healthy throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have, at least, a sponge, a basin of water,&#8221;
she proclaimed indirectly.</p>
<p>Santacilla replied, &#8220;You think nothing can
cleanse me, and, in your chattering way, you are
right; except, it may be, that last twist of steel
or ounce of lead. Some of my soldiers are planning
to manage it; I know them well, and I gave
one an opportunity today: I stood with my back
to him in the parapet of the Twelve Apostles for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
three, five, minutes, while he tramped and fiddled
with his musket, and then I put him in a hole in
the stone for a year.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The other Spanish officer, Gaspar Arco de
Vaca, Santacilla&#8217;s closest companion, observed toward
Charles an air of profound civility, and his
pretence was more galling than Santacilla&#8217;s morbid
threats and exposed contempt. De Vaca was,
in temperament and appearance, purely Iberian:
he was of middle height, he carried his slender
body with an assured insulting grace, and had a
narrow high-boned face, a bigoted nose and a
moustache like a scrolling of India ink on a repressed
and secretive mouth. Charles often encountered
him in the Fencing School on the Prado,
across from the Villa Nueva Theatre. The officers
of Isabella congregated there late in the
afternoon, where they occupied all the chairs and
filled the bare room with the soft stamp of their
heels and the harsh grinding of engaged buttoned
steel. The foils, however, were not always covered:
there had been some fatalities from duelling
in the sala de Armas since Charles Abbott had
been in Havana; a Cuban gentleman past sixty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
had been slain by a subaltern of seventeen; two
officers, quarreling over a crillo girl, had sustained
punctured lungs, from which one had
bled to death.</p>
<p>The Cubans, it was made evident, were there
by sufferance, and the fencing master, Galope
Hormiguero, an officer who had been retired
from a Castilian regiment under the shadow of
an unprovoked murder, made little effort to conceal
his disdain of the Islanders. Charles he regarded
without interest: he was a faithful student,
and made all the required passes, engaged
the other beginning students, with regularity; but
even he saw that he would never be notably skilful
with the foil or rapier or broadsword.
Charles had a delicate sense of touch, he bore
himself firmly, his eye was true; he had the appearance
of mastery, but the essence of it was
not in him. His heart, Hormiguero frequently
told him, was like a sponge; he wasn&#8217;t tempered
to the commanding of death.</p>
<p>He agreed, silently, that he wasn&#8217;t a butcher;
and as for his heart&mdash;time would show its material.
Meanwhile he kept up the waist and forearm
exercises, the indicated breathing, gaining, if
not a different spirit, a harder and cured body.
The room was large, with the usual high windows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
on a balcony, and strips of coco-matting over
the tiled floor. A light wooden partition provided
dressing space, the chairs were carried
about hither and there, and the racks of foils
against the walls reflected the brightness of day
in sudden long shivers like other and immaterial
blades. It had been, originally, a drawing-room,
the cornice was elaborate, and painted on the
ceiling were flying cupids and azure and cornucopias
of spilling flowers.</p>
<p>At moments of rest, his chest laboring and
arms limp at his sides, Charles Abbott would
stare up at the remote pastoral of love and Venus
and roses. Then the clamor, the wicked
scrape of steel, the sharp breaths, the sibilant
cries that accompanied the lunges, would appear
wholly incomprehensible to him, a business in a
mad-house; he&#8217;d want to tear the plastron, with
its scarlet heart sewn high on the left, from his
chest, and fling it, with his gauntlet and mask,
across the floor; he&#8217;d want to break all the foils,
and banish Galope Hormiguero to live among
the wild beasts he resembled. He was deep in
such a mood when de Vaca&#8217;s considerate tones
roused him. &#8220;Positively,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are like
one of the heroes who held Mexico on the point
of his sword or who swept the coast of Peru of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
its gold. And you are idle, for you see no one
who can hold the mat with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In reality,&#8221; Charles replied, &#8220;I fence very
awkwardly. But you have often seen me, I
haven&#8217;t any need to tell you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That can never be established without experience,&#8221;
the Spaniard asserted; &#8220;I should have
to feel your wrist against mine. If you will be
patient, if you will wait for me, I&#8217;ll risk a public
humiliation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Abbott said evenly: &#8220;I&#8217;d be very glad
to fence with you, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>When de Vaca, flawlessly appointed, returned,
Charles rose steadily, and strapped on his mask,
tightened the leather of the plastron. A murmur
of subdued amusement followed their walking
out together onto an unoccupied strip&mdash;de
Vaca was a celebrated swordsman. Charles saluted
acceptably, but the wielding of the other&#8217;s
gesture of courtesy filled him with admiration.
The foils struck together, there was a conventional
pass and parry, and from that moment
Charles Abbott lost control of his steel. At a
touch from de Vaca, scarcely perceptible, his foil
rose or fell, swept to one side or the other; a
lunge would end in the button describing a whole
arc, and pointing either to the matting or the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
winged and cherubic cupids. The laughter from
the chairs grew louder, more unguarded, and
then settled into a constant stream of applause
and merriment.</p>
<p>Disengaged, he said in tones which he tried in
vain to make steady, &#8220;You have a beautiful
hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Vaca, his eyes shining blackly through
wire mesh, thanked him in the politest language
known. He began, then, to make points, touches,
wherever he chose&mdash;with a remarkably timed
twist he tore the cloth heart from Charles&#8217; wadding;
he indicated, as though he were a teacher
with a pointer, anatomical facts and regions; de
Vaca seemed to be calling Charles&#8217; attention, by
sharp premonitory taps, to what he might have
been saying. There were now a number of voices
encouraging and applauding him; he was begged
not to be so hard upon Gaspar; and it was hoped
that he was not giving way to the venting of a
secret spite. A nerveless parry in tierce brought
out a tempestuous support&mdash;</p>
<p>His arm was as heavy, as numb, as lead, the
conventional period had been ignored, and his torment
went on and on. His chest, he thought,
must burst under the strapped plastron, and sweat
poured in a sheet across his eyes. The episode
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
seemed utterly meaningless, undemanded; the
more remarkable because of de Vaca&#8217;s indifference
to him, to all the trivialities of his Cuban
duty. How yellow the face was, the eyes were
like jet, through the mask. Then Charles Abbott
grasped what, he was certain, was the purpose
of such an apparently disproportionate attack.
It was the result of a cold effort, a set determination,
to destroy what courage he had. He
gazed quickly about, and saw nothing but Spanish
faces; the fencing master was in the far end
of the room, intent upon a sheaf of foils. At any
moment de Vaca could have disarmed him, sent
his steel flying through air; but that he forebore
to do. Instead he opposed his skill, his finesse,
his strength, in the attack upon Charles Abbott&#8217;s
fibre.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I collapse,&#8221; Charles told himself, &#8220;it will
be for eternity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any sense of time was disintegrated in a physical
agony which required all his wasting being to
combat. But, even worse <ins title='Was that'>than</ins> that, far more
destructive, was the assault upon his mind. If
he crumbled ... he thought of himself as dust,
his brain a dry powder in his skull. The laughter
around him, which had seemed to retreat farther
and farther, had ceased, as though it had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
been lost in the distance. The room, widening
to an immensity of space, was silent, charged with
a malignant expectancy. Soon, Charles felt, he
would fall into unreckoned depths of corrupt
shadows, among the obscene figures of the hideously
lost.</p>
<p>The sweat streaming into his mouth turned
thick and salt&mdash;blood, from his nose. There was
a tumult in his head: his fencing now was the
mere waving of a reed. Again and again the
Spaniard&#8217;s foil, as cruelly and vitally direct as
at the first pass, struck within Charles&#8217; guard.
The face of wood, of yellow wood, the eyes that
were bits of coal, behind the mask, pursued him
into the back of his brain. It stirred, there, a
smothering instinct, a dormant memory, and
Charles, with a wrenching effort, in a voice thin
like a trickle of water from a spigot, said again,
&#8220;&mdash;a most beautiful hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharply, incomprehensibly, it was over.
Drooping forward upon his knees, dropping his
foil from paralysed fingers, he saw de Vaca, with
his mask on an arm, frowning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Charles Abbott thought luxuriously,
&#8220;I can faint and be damned to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cloud of darkness which flowed over him
was empty of the vileness of fear; rather, like the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
beneficence of night, it was an utterly peaceful
remission of the flesh.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>His physical exhaustion, the weariness of his
mind, continued in a settled lassitude through the
following day. He was to see Andrés Escobar,
give him what information he had had from La
Clavel, the next morning at the baths of the Campos
Eliseos; and meanwhile he scarcely stirred
from the San Felipe. Charles, for the time,
lacked the bravado necessary for the sustaining of
his pretence. His thoughts, turned in upon his
own acts and prospects, dwelt quietly on his determination.
He had changed appreciably during
his stay in Havana; even his physiognomy was
different how, he couldn&#8217;t say, but he was aware
that his expression had, well, hardened. The
cure which had been the principally hoped-for
result of Cuba was complete. In spite of his
collapse in the fencing school, he was more compactly
strong than ever before. It occurred to
him that, now, he might be described as a man.</p>
<p>This brought him a certain pleasure, and, in
keeping with that state, he tried to simplify, to
comprehend, the idealism which dominated him.
He didn&#8217;t want to grasp vainly at rosy clouds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
His first attitude, one of hardly more than boyish
excitement, had soon become a deep impersonal
engagement&mdash;he had promised himself to
Cuba. That will was stronger than ever; but
the schooling of the past weeks, together with the
stiffening of his spirit, had bred a new practicality
in him, superior, he felt, to any sheer heroics.
He vastly preferred the latter, he hadn&#8217;t totally
lost the inspiring mental picture of a glorious
sacrifice; but he had come to the realization that
it was more important to stay alive. What, in
reality, he was trying to do was to see himself
consecutively, logically.</p>
<p>In this, he recognized, his mind was different
from the Escobars&#8217;, from the blind fervor of
the many Cuban patriots he knew. He could
see that reflected in their manner toward him: no
trace of Vincente&#8217;s aloofness remained, they had
come, forgetting his comparative youth, his alien
blood, to regard him with almost an anxiety of respect.
When it was possible, men of the widest
possible activities talked to him of their plans.
In short, Charles Abbott felt that he might become
a power; and this he coolly set himself to
bring about. His heritage was that of success;
there were distinguished men, who had carried
alone heavy responsibilities to their justified end,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
no more than two or three generations behind him.
His mother, he thought gladly, surveying her in
the clearness of a full detachment, had an astonishing
courage of spirit. Charles told himself
that he would have to become a politician; his
undiminished idealism, without which his validity
was nothing, must be shut into his heart, held
purely for the communication of its force and
for his own benefit.</p>
<p>The simple path of truth, of partisan enthusiasm,
must be put aside. The uncalculating
bravery of the men gathered about General Agramonte
was of indispensable value; but undirected,
with no brain to make secure, to put into operation,
the fire they created, that would come to
little. He wished that his connection, his duty,
with La Clavel was over, that he could delegate it
elsewhere, but, obviously, for the moment, that
was impossible. It merely remained for him,
then, to take no unpondered chances, never again
to be drawn into such a situation as he had faced
with Gaspar Arco de Vaca.</p>
<p>Before such a sharp decision, a certain amount
of his sheer joy evaporated: it was less inspiring
to be cautious than daring. The Cubans themselves,
always excepting Andrés, had lost an appreciable
amount of their glamour for him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
They were, now, units, elements, to be managed,
to be tranquilized, steadied, moved about. All
this, of course, was yet to come; the recognition
of him was instinctive rather than acknowledged.
But, he repeated to himself, it was forming,
spreading. That, then, was the shape, the actuality,
of his vision&mdash;to establish himself indispensably
at the fore of a Cuban liberty, incipient,
dreamed of, and accomplished. All his thoughts
dropped, almost with the audible smooth clicking
of meshed steel gears, into place. The last
degree of joy was replaced by a fresh calm maturity.
He would never, it was obvious, be a
leader of soldiers, and he had no desire to become
the visible head of government; no, his intention
was other than that of Carlos de Cespedes. He
viewed his future self rather as a powerful source
of advice with a house on the Prado. It was
curious how coldly, exactly, he planned so much;
and he stopped to examine his ambition even
more closely and to discover if it were merely
absurd.</p>
<p>It struck him that it might be he had lost too
much, that already he had become selfish, ambitious
for himself, and he recalled the religious
aspect so quickly gone. No, he decided, his effort
was to bridge that space, already recognized,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
between desire and realization. Anyhow, he determined
to speak of this as well to Andrés during
their bath. The April temporale lay in an
even heat over the city, and the end of the Paseo
Isabel was crowded by the quitrins of women, the
caleseros, in their brilliant livery, sleeping in
whatever shade offered. The Escobars had a private
bath, but Andrés preferred the larger baño
publico, where it was possible to swim, and there
Charles found him. The basin had been hollowed
from the coral rock; it was perhaps
eighteen or twenty feet square, and the height of
the water, with a passage for a fresh circulation
cut in the front wall, was level with the calm
reach of the sea.</p>
<p>The pool, as clear as slightly congealed and
cooled air, open to the horizon, was roofed, with
a railed ledge and steps descending into the
water, and Andrés Escobar sat with his legs half
immersed. He greeted Charles conventionally,
concealing the pleasure which shone in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I stopped at your dressing-room,&#8221; Charles
Abbott told him; &#8220;anything might be taken from
the pockets of your coat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The converse of this possibility, that something
had been put into a pocket, he conveyed.
Andrés nodded indifferently. The other slid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
into the water, sinking and swimming beneath
the surface to the farther end. It was delicious.
Swimming was his only finished active accomplishment;
and, with a half concealed pride, he
exhibited it in skilful variations. Even the public
bath, he felt, was too contracted for the full
expression of his ability. In addition to this, it
was necessary to talk confidentially to Andrés.
And so, with a wave of his arm, he indicated the
freedom of the sea beyond.</p>
<p>Andrés Escobar followed him over the stone
barrier, and together they swam steadily out into
the blue. Finally, they rested, floating, and
Charles diffidently related what was in his
heart. His friend, less secure in the water, listened
with a gravity occasionally marred by a
mouthful of sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he agreed, when Charles had
finished. &#8220;Although you have put it modestly,
I think&mdash;many of us admit&mdash;that you may be a
strong man in Cuba. Indeed, I have heard it
said that you should go back to America, and
put more intensity into the Junta. Naturally I
should regret that, but we must all do what, in
the end, is best. Charles, there is a great deal
of water under and around us, and I should feel
better nearer the Campos Eliseos.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; Charles Abbott replied with a touch
of impatience; &#8220;you are quite safe, there is no
tide at present.&#8221; Floating in the calm immensity,
his arms outspread, his face, at once burned
by the sun and lapped by water, turned to the
opposed azure above, he drew in accession after
accession of a determination like peace. Nothing
should upset what he had planned. There
was a stir beside him&mdash;André Escobar was returning
to the shore, and lazily, thoughtfully, he
swam back. The Cuban left immediately, for
breakfast; but Charles lingered in the pool,
lounging upon the wooden grilling with a cigarette.
One by one the bathers went away. The
sky, the sea, were a blaze of blue. The clatter
of hoofs, the caleseros&#8217; departing cries, sounded
from the Paseo. &#8220;Charles Abbott,&#8221; he repeated
his own name aloud with an accent of surprise.
What, whom, did it describe? He gazed down
over his drying body. This, then, was he&mdash;the
two legs, thin but sufficiently muscular, the trunk
in a swimming suit, the arms and hands! His
hidden brain, his invisible mind, was himself as
well; and, of the two, the mind and the body, the
unseen was overwhelmingly the more important.
He remembered how, fencing with de Vaca, the
body had failed him utterly; de Vaca, attacking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
his will, was contemptuous of the other ... and
his will had survived. Rising, he felt that he
commanded himself absolutely; he had no sympathy,
no patience, for frailty, for a failure
through the celebrated weaknesses of humanity:
hardness was the indispensable trait of success.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The whole of reasonably intelligent life,
Charles discovered, was disrupted by the ceaseless
clash of two utterly opposed ideas, emotions.
There was, first, the need in the individual to
serve, to justify, himself, to maintain his integrity;
and, as well, there was the duty&mdash;at least, it
was universally called a duty&mdash;of a self-sacrifice
for love. The failures of superior men came
largely, he was certain, in the breaking down of
the first through the second. A man, for example,
put into motion the accomplishment of his own
demand, and then was appalled by the incidental
price, but more to others than to himself. Yes,
love betrayed men. The Escobars were, inseparably,
Cuba, they were happily merged, lost,
in one supreme cause; yet the superiority of their
hearts over the head endangered their dearest preoccupation.
They saw symbols as realities, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
wrongly valued emotion more highly than reasoning.</p>
<p>And further, Charles returned to himself, if
he had consulted and listened to his parents, if
his love of home had outweighed his singular
vision, he would be nothing now but an unimportant
drifting figure. His parents had had more
knowledge of life than he; undoubtedly their
counsel, in the main, was correct, safe. That
word, safe, was it specially. The instinct of his
mother was to preserve, to spare, him; to win for
him as smooth a passage through life as was procurable.
She had her particular feminine idea
of what, in her son, spelled solid accomplishment;
and, with all her spirit, it was material in so far
as it was visible: position in a settled community,
the money necessary for an existence both
dignified and ornamental, a &#8220;nice&#8221; wife&mdash;another
devoted sheltering soul such as herself&mdash;and
well-behaved handsome children. The inner
qualities she demanded for him were faith,
honesty, and fidelity.</p>
<p>Her vision of a broad close-cut lawn and grey
stone house with pillars and a port-cochère, his
wife, in silks and chaste jewels, receiving a polite
company in the drawing-room, was admirable.
In it he would be gray-haired and, together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
with an increasing stoutness, of an assured
dignity. His children would worship his wisdom
and paternal benevolence, and the world of
affairs would listen to him with attentive respect.
It was, unquestionably, an impressive
conception. Every detail was excellent, but he
cared for, revered, none of them.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t want to be safe, to decline softly to
a soft old age, a death smothered in feathers.
More than anything else his desire was to live
intensely, to ride, upright, the crest of a thunderous
wave. He hated, now, every phase of a decent
suburban smugness. Someone else was
welcome to the girl designated, by his mother, to
be his wife. Someone other than himself might
sit across the dinner-table from her, week after
week, month after month, year after year, and
watch her stereotyped face beyond the cut flowers;
another might listen to the interminable gabble
about servants and neighbors and dresses and
cards. The children would be differently, more
appropriately, fathered; his, Charles Abbott&#8217;s,
potential children were gathered into an ideal
that was, too, an idea. It must be served, realized,
within the dimensions of his own bone and
fibre; it was exclusively his, his the danger, the
penalty and the reward. Charles would not have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
had it different, even if, although none existed,
he had any choice.</p>
<p>He must, however, prepare himself against the
betrayal he was able to trace so clearly in others;
there could be no faltering, no remorse; he was
cut off from the ordinary solaces, the comfortable
compactness, of general living. But, already,
temperamentally, he liked, preferred, this; alone,
never for a minute was he lonely. The inattention
to home, primarily the result of a new
scene and of exciting circumstances, had grown
into an impersonal fondness for his family; he
failed to miss them, to wish for their presence.
The only element that remained from the past
was his love for Andrés Escobar; he confronted
it valorously, deposed it from his mind, but it
clung around his heart. How fortunate it was
that Andrés could not detach him from his resolve;
it was unthinkable that one should stand
in the way of the other.</p>
<p>These reflections occupied his mind at various
times and places: one day in the American Consulate
on Obispo Street; again at the steamship
office on Mercaderes; over his cigarette and
cheese and jelly at the Noble Havana; strolling
along Ricla Street where the principal shops were
congregated; at a dinner party in the Palace of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
the Conde de Santovernia. He was aloof. All
the activity that absorbed the people among
whom he went was to him trivial, utterly of no
consequence. Sometimes he would walk through
the stalls of the Mercado de Cristina, on the
Plaza Vieja, or in through the Honradez factory
on Sol Street, where a handful of cigars was
courteously given to any appreciative visitor.
He would return along the Paseo de Valdez to
the park where he had sat when he was first in
Cuba, and, as then, the strains of the military
band of the Cabañas drifted across the bay.</p>
<p>The dwelling of the Captain-General, with the
Royal Lottery on the ground floor, had before it
sentries in red and white; the Quay de Caballeria,
reached through the Plaza of San Francisco,
was tempered and pleasant in the early dusk, and
at the Quay de Machina was a small garden
with grotesque rosy flamingoes and gold-fish in
the fountain. He sat, as well, lonely, considering
and content, in the Alameda de Paula, where,
by the glorieta, it was called the Salon O&#8217;Donnell.
The moats, filled with earth, truck gardens,
the shore covered with sugar pans, engaged his
absent-minded interest. With the improvement
of his Spanish, he deserted the better known
cafés and restaurants, the insolence of the Castilian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
officers, for modest Cuban places of food,
where he drank Catalan wine, and smoked the
Vegueros, the rough excellent plantation cigars.</p>
<p>This new mood, he was relieved to find, gave
his acquaintances as much amusement as his public
dissipation&mdash;it was ascribed to the predicted
collapse of his love affair with La Clavel. She
was, he was rallied, growing tired of his attentions;
and, in the United States Club, he was requested
not to drown himself, because of the
trouble it would cause his country. Captain
Santacilla, however, studied him with a growing
ill-humor; his peculiar threats and small brutalities
had stopped, but his temper, Charles recognized,
was becoming dangerous. He declared
frankly, in the Café Dominica, that Charles
wasn&#8217;t the fool he appeared, and he repeated his
assertions of the need for a deportation or worse.</p>
<p>This was a condition which, sooner or later,
must be met, and for which Charles prepared
himself. Both Cubans and Spaniards occasionally
disappeared forever&mdash;the former summarily
shot by a file of muskets in a fosse, and the latter,
straying in the anonymous paths of dissipation,
quieted by a patriotic or vindictive knife. This,
it seemed to Charles Abbott, would be the wisest
plan with Santacilla; and he had another strange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
view of himself considering and plotting a murder.
The officer, who had an extraordinary
sense of intangible surrounding feelings and pressures,
spoke again to Charles of the efforts to
dispose of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man doesn&#8217;t draw breath who will do
it,&#8221; he proclaimed to Charles, at the entrance to
the Valla de Gallo. &#8220;It&#8217;s a superstition, but I&#8217;d
back it with my last onza of gold. I&#8217;ve seen it
in you very lately, but give it up. Or don&#8217;t give
it up. Either way you are unimportant. I can&#8217;t
understand why you are still here, why I permit
you to live. If I remember it I&#8217;ll speak to my
sergeant, Javier Gua: he performs such an errand
to a nicety. I have taken a dislike to you,
very unreasonably, for you are no more than a
camarone. I believe, for all your appearance of
money, that La Clavel supports you; it is her
doblons, I am certain, you gamble away and
spend for food.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Abbott smiled at the insult:</p>
<p>&#8220;On one hand I hear that she has thrown me
over and then you say that she supports me.
Which, I wonder, is to be preferred? But
neither, fortunately, is true. I can still buy her
a bouquet of camellias and she will still wear it.
As for the money, I never lose at gambling, Santacilla,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
I am always successful; the cards are in
my favor. If I bet on the black, it turns up;
and when I choose the red, affairs are red.&#8221;</p>
<p>Santacilla&#8217;s uneasy eyes shifted over him suspiciously.
&#8220;Blood and death, that is what black
and red are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But you are not the dispenser
of fate.&#8221; The peak of his cockaded hat
threw a shadow over his sanguine face to the
chin. &#8220;A camarone,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;a stalk of
celery. Gua, and I&#8217;ll remember to tell him, will
part you from your conceit.&#8221; There was a metallic
crowing of roosters as the officer turned away.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>La Clavel noticed a marked difference in
Charles, but proclaimed that it was no more than
an increase in his natural propensity for high-mindedness.
It fatigued her, she declared, to be
with him, made her dizzy to gaze up at his altitude
of mind. He was seated in her room, the hairdresser
was sweating in the attempt to produce an
effect she was describing to him with phrases as
stinging as the whip of foils, while Charles
watched her with a degree of annoyance. Her
humors, where he was concerned, were unpredictable;
and lately she had found a special
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
delight in attacks on his dignity. She said and
did things&mdash;an air of innocence hiding her malice&mdash;indecently
ribald that shook his firmest efforts
to appear, to be, unconcerned.</p>
<p>At last, in a volatile rage, she dismissed the
servant with his tongs and pomatum and crimping
leads, and swore to Charles Abbott that she
was going to the Argentine by the first boat that
offered passage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sick of Cuba, and I&#8217;ve forgotten that I
am an artist, and that is bad. You are wrapped
up in this liberty, and that is very well for you,
an ordinary person. You must have something
like that, outside you, to follow, for you&#8217;ve very
little within. But me, I am not an ordinary person;
I am La Clavel. I am more valuable to
the world than pumpkins or republics. I stamp
my heel,&#8221; she stamped her heel, a clear sharp
sound, and her body swept into a line passionate
and tense, &#8220;and I create a people, a history.&#8221; La
Clavel secured the castanets lying on her dressing-table&mdash;in
answer to their irritable rhythmic
clinking she projected, for an instant, a vision of
all desire.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make men forget; I can draw them out
of their sorrows and away from their homes; I
can put fever in their blood that will blind them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
to memories and duty. Or I can be a drum, and
lead them out, without a regret, a fear, to death.
That is more than a naranjada or a cigar or an
election. And, because of what I have given you,
I have put that out of my life; I have been living
like the mistress of a bodega. To be clear,
Charles, I am tired of you and Cuba, and I have
satisfied my hatred of the officers with cologne on
their handkerchiefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that perfectly,&#8221; Charles Abbott
assured her; &#8220;and I cannot beg you to stay.
Whatever your motive was, your value to us has
been beyond any payment. If our movement
had a saint, you would fill that place.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed, &#8220;A strange saint in a mantón
and slippers with painted heels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much better,&#8221; Charles replied, &#8220;than many of
those in sanctified robes. I had the feeling, too,&#8221;
he proceeded, &#8220;that our usefulness together was
coming to an end.&#8221; It seemed to him that again
she had become the glorified figure of the stage,
his dislike for her actuality, her flesh, vanished,
leaving only profound admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am amazed,&#8221; she said, in a lingering half
humorous resentment, &#8220;that you never loved me,
I never brought you a regret or a longing or made
any trouble in your heart.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That was because I put you so high,&#8221; he explained.
She raised her shoulders and objected
that it was late for compliments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be honest&mdash;you didn&#8217;t care for me. You
ought to be very successful, you have things surprising
in the so young. Will you,&#8221; she demanded
suddenly, totally changing the subject,
&#8220;be my maid?&#8221; He hastened to inform her,
vehemently, that he would not. &#8220;Jobaba hasn&#8217;t
come today,&#8221; La Clavel continued; &#8220;and she
wasn&#8217;t here to dress me for dinner last evening.
That is unusual in her: I have a feeling she is
not coming back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps she has been murdered in one of the
brujos cabildos,&#8221; Charles suggested. &#8220;It is impossible
to say where that frenzy stops.&#8221; A
happening quite different, the dancer told him,
was in her mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could never get into the thoughts of
Jobaba,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;And there is very little
I miss. I suppose it&#8217;s the negro. She is like
cream, smooth and beautiful to look at, but
turned by thunder.&#8221; If she were going away,
Charles reminded her, there were a number of
things to be discussed and closed. And she told
Charles how a Cuban, ostensibly attached to the
national party, but in reality a Spanish secret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
agent, had been sent into Camagüey. His name
was Rimblas.</p>
<p>Charles Abbott repeated that, and memorized
such characteristics as La Clavel knew. There
was an indefinite stir at the door, a short knock,
and he moved to the window as Santacilla entered
unceremoniously.</p>
<p>The Spaniard was a model of politeness, of
consideration, and he listened, seated with his
hands folded about the head of his officer&#8217;s cane,
to La Clavel&#8217;s determination to go to South
America. It was an excellent plan, he agreed;
they would welcome her rapturously in Buenos
Aires; but hadn&#8217;t she put off her intention a little
too long? It was on account of the climate, the
season, he hastened to add. Although, of course,
they would open the opera house for her,
the smart world would come in from their estancias.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what will our young American do?&#8221; he
demanded. &#8220;How will he live without his delight?
But perhaps he is going to the Argentine
with you. He will have a busy time, and a hatful
of challenges there, where beauty is appreciated
to the full.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles said, with an appearance of sullenness,
that he hadn&#8217;t been invited to go farther
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
south; and Santacilla replied that, as a matter of
fact, it might be necessary for him to remain, perhaps
forever, in Havana. He spoke cheerfully,
gazing amiably upon them, but a vague quality
of his bearing, his voice, was disturbing, mocking.
His words had the air of an underlying meaning
different from their sound. An uneasiness,
as well, was communicated to La Clavel:
she watched Santacilla with an indirect puzzled
gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jobaba has gone,&#8221; she announced abruptly.</p>
<p>The trace of a smile hovered about the officer&#8217;s
expression of regret. &#8220;A personable clip of hell,&#8221;
was his opinion of the strayed maid. &#8220;Do you
remember the major who composed music?&#8221; he
addressed La Clavel. &#8220;Well, he was always a
little touched in the brain, and he caught this
negro hysteria, he became a brujos. He&#8217;d come
home in the morning with his body marked in
yellow chalk, and wrung out like a boatman&#8217;s
sponge; and he let drop a fact or two about your
Jobaba screaming to an African drum rubbed
with the fingers. In that state, he said, a great
deal that was curious and valuable could be
dragged from her. We encouraged his madness,
at the Cabañas, for what it brought us. But it
was unfortunate for him&mdash;he ties bright rags
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
about his ankles and mumbles, when he thinks
he is alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Abbott&#8217;s mind, sifting all that the other
said, was abnormally active, sharp. Something,
he couldn&#8217;t quite grasp what, was acutely, threateningly,
wrong. He had a sense of impending
danger, a premonition of dashing sound, of discord.
And, whatever developed, he must meet
it, subdue and conquer it. Ceaza y Santacilla,
he saw, was not visibly armed; but, probably, he
would carry a small pistol. The one his father
had given him was in Charles&#8217; pocket. The difficulty
was that, in the event of a disturbance, no
matter what the outcome here might happen to
be, the dancer and he would bear the weight of
any Spanish fury. And it was no part of his
intention to be cut in half by bullets behind a
fortress wall.</p>
<p>He could only delay, discover as soon as possible
what was behind Santacilla&#8217;s deceiving patience
and good humor. Upon that he would
have to act without hesitation and with no chance
of failure. The regiment should, the dancer complained,
send her maid back to her. Manners
were very much corrupted beyond the western
ocean&mdash;in Sevilla the servant would have been
dispatched in a bullock cart deep in roses. That,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
he answered, reminded him of another procession,
a different cart; but it was more French
than Castilian&mdash;the tumbril.</p>
<p>He was seated against a wall at a right angle
from the door, and Charles left the vicinity of the
window, lounging across the room. La Clavel
said, &#8220;I know you so well, Ceaza, what is it;
what is it you are saying and saying without
speaking of? Your mind is like a locked metal
box that shows only the flashes on the surface.
But you must open it for us. It seems as though
you were threatening me, and that, you best
should realize, is useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>His flickering eyes rested first on her and then
upon Charles Abbott. &#8220;You will never get to
South America now,&#8221; he asserted; &#8220;for you are
a conspirator against your King. Since you
have shown such a love of Cuban soil you are to
become a part of it forever.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Charles Abbott, now standing by the door, shot
in the bolt which secured it, and, by a fortunate,
a chance, twist, broke off the handle. Santacilla,
undisturbed, remained seated, smiling while his
fingers played with the plaited loop of his cane.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>&#8220;This infatuation,&#8221; he indicated them with a
wave, &#8220;while it convinced Havana, never entirely
satisfied me. I have been watching you,
Jobaba has been listening, for days. You were
very cunning, but, in the end, you failed; you
were neither skilful nor patient enough. Yet,
at the last, all that you heard were fairy tales&mdash;the
spy that was sent to Camagüey, ha!&#8221;</p>
<p>La Clavel faced him calmly, but, Charles saw,
she was pale. He was revolving a hundred impractical
schemes: they had only one end, the
death of Santacilla, but how that was to be
brought about with safety to Cuba evaded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not a traitor in the way you mean,&#8221; she
declared; &#8220;what your conceit never allowed you
to note was that, in Spain and here, I have always
detested you; and what I did was the result
of that. I struck at you and not at our
country, for the court and church and army are
no longer our strength&mdash;if we still have any except
the knife and cord&mdash;but our weakness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fools,&#8221; he asserted, unmoved.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now you are the fool,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you are wrong; I am only enjoying myself
before the show is over. I wanted to see
you, and your young devotee, twist and turn
before the fact of death. I have killed, and seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
executed, a number of people, men and women;
but I was still curious&mdash;a great dancer and a
rich young American. That is an unusual day.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was best, Charles Abbott decided, to bring
about as much as possible with no more delay;
the prime necessary act accomplished, they could
face the problems of the immediate future steadily.
He quietly produced his pistol and levelled
it. The dry click which alone followed the pulling
of the trigger made the officer aware of the
attempt upon his life. A dark angry surge invaded
his face, and then receded. &#8220;No man will
ever kill me,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;It is my star.&#8221; A
hand left the cane and produced a small gold
whistle.</p>
<p>Charles stared dully at the useless weapon,
with its mounting of mother-of-pearl, which he
still held.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cartridges have been too long in their
barrels,&#8221; Santacilla explained; &#8220;they have dried
and shifted. You should have greased them
every week.&#8221;</p>
<p>La Clavel stood, lost in thought, like a
woman in a dream. Her hair, over which she
had spent such time and curses, was an elaborate
silhouette against the light. &#8220;Ceaza, Ceaza,&#8221; she
implored, going to him, &#8220;you must let me go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
and dance in Buenos Aires, they have never seen
me there, it is necessary to my career.&#8221; She was
close beside him, when he rose suddenly, pushing
the chair between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You Andalusian devil!&#8221; he cried, and put
the whistle to his lips. Before he could blow,
the dancer had flung herself on him, with an arm
bound about his neck, a hand dragging at his
throat. The whistle fell, the chair was brushed
aside, and the man and woman, in a straining
desperate grip, swayed into the middle of the
floor.</p>
<p>Charles, driven by an inherited instinct to protect
La Clavel, to replace her in such a struggle,
caught at either of the locked shoulders; but,
whirling in the passion of their strife, they struck
him aside. He made another effort to pull Santacilla
to the floor, without success; and then,
with a small stout chair in his hands, he waited
for an opportunity to bring it crashing on the
officer&#8217;s head. He was appalled by the fury of
the woman silently trying to choke her enemy;
her other hand, grasping the thin glimmer of the
knife always convenient in her stocking, the
officer held away from them. Her years of dancing,
her early hardening life in the mountains,
had given her a strength and litheness now tearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
at the weight, the masculinity, of Santacilla.
He was trying, in vain, to break her wrist, to
close his fingers into her throat; and, bending,
the fragility of her clothes ripped across her
sinuous back. Shifting and evading the thrust of
his power, she was sending the blood in purple
waves over his neck and thick cheeks. Neither
of them cried out, spoke; there was only the
sound of hoarse breathing, inarticulate expressions
of unendurable strain. Charles Abbott,
raising, holding poised, the chair, and lowering it,
was choked with the grappling horror before him.</p>
<p>La Clavel&#8217;s face was as blanched as the officer&#8217;s
was dark, her eyes were wide-open and set, as
though she were in a galvanic trance. Again
and again Santacilla tried to tear away her arms,
to release himself from the constriction at his
neck. His fingers dug red furrows through her
flesh, they tormented and outraged her. A palm
closed upon her countenance, and blood ran
from under it. But there was no weakening of
her force, no slackening in her superb body.
She seemed curiously impersonal; robbed of all
traits of women; she was like a symbolical fate,
the figure from a shield, from an emblem, dragging
him to death.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, in an inadequate muffled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
voice burdened with a shuddering echo of fear, he
cried for her to release him. It was so unexpected,
he became so inexplicably limp, that La
Clavel backed away instinctively. Charles
started forward, the chair lifted high; but he was
stopped by the expression, the color, of Ceazy
Santacilla&#8217;s face. The officer turned, with his
hands at his throat, toward the window. He
took an uncertain step, and then stood wavering,
strangely helpless, pathetically stricken.</p>
<p>&#8220;The air,&#8221; he whispered; &#8220;hot as wine.&#8221; He
pitched abruptly face forward upon the floor.</p>
<p>La Clavel tried to speak against the labored
heaving of her breast, but what she attempted to
say was unintelligible. Charles, slipping back
the broken bolt with a finger in its orifice, listened
intently at the door. The Hotel St. Louis
was wrapped undisturbed in its siesta; no alarm
had been created. Santacilla lay as he had
fallen, an arm loosely outspread, a leg doubled
unnaturally under its fellow. He bore the laxness,
the emptiness, of death. He had spoken
truly that it wasn&#8217;t in his star to be killed by a
man. Finding that he was still holding the
chair, Charles put it softly down. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;the revolution is through with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced suddenly at La Clavel. She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
drooping, disheveled and hideous; her hair lay
on her bare shoulders in coarse strands; her face
was swollen with bruises. Now, he realized, she
would never see the Argentine; she would never
again hear the shouted olés that greeted, rewarded,
the brilliancy of her jota. His thoughts
shifted to Cuba and himself&mdash;if it were a crime
of passion that had been committed in her room,
the cause, there, would be freed from suspicion.
He had, as customary, come directly, unostentatiously,
to her room, and he was certain that he
had not been observed. A duty, hard in the extreme,
was before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you bring about Santacilla&#8217;s
death?&#8221; he demanded. She gazed at him dully,
uncomprehendingly. &#8220;It was because he was
jealous,&#8221; he proceeded; &#8220;you must hold to that.&#8221;
She nodded, dazed. &#8220;When they come into
the room and find him you must show what he
did to you. And, after all, you didn&#8217;t kill him.
Perhaps that will save you,&#8221; his voice was without
conviction. &#8220;They won&#8217;t believe you, and
they may try measures to get at the truth; but
you will be faithful. You will keep your secret,
and&mdash;and I must go. I shall ask for you downstairs,
make them send up a servant, and shout
as loudly as any.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>She held up her battered countenance dumbly
and, with a feeling of transcendent reverence, he
kissed her cut lips. Thrown across the end of
the bed, the shawl she had danced in, blazing
with gay color, cast the reflection of its carmines
and yellows on the calcimined wall. It was like
a burst of the music which accompanied her
dancing. The castanets lay on the floor. The
blessed saint of Cuban independence! Then
the caution that had become a part of his necessity
rode uppermost: he proceeded silently to the
door, and, closing it behind him, went, meeting
no one, to the ground floor, where he pulled irritably
at the wire hanging from a bell under the
ceiling. The raw jangle brought a servant, a
rosy-cheeked Gallego boy, heavy with sleep, who
went stumbling up the stairs on Charles&#8217; errand.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In his own room a wave of physical horror
swept over Charles Abbott; he was obliged to
sit down, and the chair, the floor, seemed to
rock at the giddy sickness of the memory of Santacilla,
stumbling with a wine-colored face toward
the window in a vain gasping for air, for
life. He recovered slowly: notwithstanding the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
death of Tirso Labrador, the wasted shape of
Andrés&#8217; brother, all the tragedies he had heard
reported, it was not until now that he realized
the entire grimness of the undertaking against
Spain. The last possibility of the spectacular
departed, leaving him with a new sense of the
imminence of death. He had considered this,
under certain circumstances welcoming it, or dismissing
it with a creditable calmness, many times
before; but then his attitude had been softened
by the detachment, the impersonality, of his view.
But at last the feeling of death was tangibly at
his own throat; not today, nor tomorrow, probably;
but inescapably. Well, he assured himself,
he wouldn&#8217;t, at that intense moment, fail an
inner necessity; but his understanding gave him
an additional feeling of the accidental aspects
of life and of the Cuban revolution.</p>
<p>Until then he had, sub-consciously, except for
one short depression, been certain of the ultimate
triumph of right; he had thought it must succeed
through its mere rightness; and he had
pictured justice as a condition dropped beneficently
from the clouds, wrought with the thunder
of angels&#8217; wings. But accomplishment on earth,
with men, he now saw, was neither safe, easy nor
assured. It was the result of bitter struggle, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
strife open to the most appalling mischances. A
necessity of the spirit, it must be executed in the
flesh, and flesh was a treacherous, unstable substance;
it was capable not only of traitorous betrayals,
but equally of honest, and no less fatal,
failures. With this in his thoughts he went to the
door, in answer to a knock, and received a heavy
carefully tied parcel.</p>
<p>He opened it, and, dripping in dazzling color
from the wrapping paper, was La Clavel&#8217;s mantón,
the one in which he had first seen her insolently
dancing the jota. Charles, with a stirred
heart, searched carefully for a note, a scrap of revealing
paper; but there was none. She had sent
it to him silently, before she had been taken away,
in a sentiment the delicacy of which deeply
moved him. He laid the shawl over the bed,
where its cruel brilliancy filled the white-walled
room, darkened against the heat, with flashes of
magenta and orange and burning blue. La Clavel
had worn it dancing, where it emphasized her
grace and perversity and stark passion; it had
been, in Charles Abbott&#8217;s mind, synonymous with
her, with the vision she created; but, suddenly, it
lost that significance, and he saw it as the
revealed outspread pattern of his own existence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>The shawl was a map, a representation, of the
country of the spirit through which he passed;
such emotions, such heat, and such golden roses,
all had been, were, his against that background
of perilous endeavor. It seemed to float up from
the bed and to reach from coast to coast, from
end to end, of Cuba; its flowers took root and
grew, casting about splendor and perfume; the
blue widened into the sky, the tenderness of the
clasping sea; the dark greens were the shadows
of the great ceiba trees, the gloom of the jungles,
the massed royal palms of the plains. And not
only was it the setting, the country, its violent
dissonances became cries, victorious or hopeless,
the sweep of reddened swords, the explosions of
muskets. There was the blood that had welled
into the Laurel Ditch of Cabañas; and, as well,
the sultry mysterious presence of Africa in the
West&mdash;the buzzing madness of the music of the
danzón, the hysterics of brujeria.</p>
<p>Charles, at the heart of this, stood enveloped,
surrounded, by a drama like the sharp clash of
cymbals. It was easy to be overwhelmed,
strangled, blinded, by the savage color; briefly
to be obliterated. That possibility had been,
lately, very much in his mind; and he wondered,
against all his recent change, if, in the surrender
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
of his idealism, he had lost his amulet, his safety.
While he had, to a large extent, solved, for himself,
the philosophy of conduct, cleared the motives
of his acts, a great deal was inexplicable
still. He saw, dimly, that there could be little
hope of justice on any island except as the projection,
the replica, of a fundamental universal
integrity of justice. Perfection like that couldn&#8217;t
begin on the rim of being and extend inward; it
must be at the center of all life, obscured, delayed,
but, in an end not computable in the span of human
existence, certain and inevitable. Charles
Abbott now had the feeling that, parallel with the
maintaining of his grasp on materialism, his recognition
of the means at his hand, there should
be an allegiance to a supremacy of the immeasurable
whole.</p>
<p>That double vision, the acceptance of a general
good together with the possibility of extreme
ill to the individual, puzzled him. He was required
to put faith in a power seemingly indifferent
to him, to discharge a responsibility in return
for which nothing that he could weigh was
promised. Charles recalled what had overtaken
the dancer, La Clavel, in payment for a heroic
effort against an insupportable oppression. Disaster
had met the body, the flesh; what occurred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
in the spirit he was unable to grasp; but this, suddenly,
breathlessly, he saw:</p>
<p>La Clavel&#8217;s bitter defiance, her mountain-born
hatred of oppression, her beaten but undefiled
body, had communicated to him something
of her own valor. It was as though she had
given him a palm, a shielded flame, to add to his
own fortitude. In all probability she would,
soon, be dead; Charles correctly gauged the Spanish
animosity; and yet she was alive, strong, in
him. She would be living; it was Ceaza y Santacilla
who had died, been vanquished; his abnormal
refinement dropping so easily into the
bestial, the measure of evil, in him, for which he
stood, had been slain, dissipated, ended. The
shawl contracted, became a thing magnificent but
silk, a mantón invested with a significance brave
and <ins title="Was suprisingly">surprisingly</ins> tender. It was, now, the standard
of La Clavel, the mantle of the saintliness
he had proclaimed. His doubts, his questioning,
were resolved into the conviction that the act
of the dancer was her spirit made visible, created
tangibly for a tangible purpose, and that, there,
she was indestructible.</p>
<p>With that conclusion to serve as a stay and a
belief, a philosophy of conduct, he returned from
the extra-mundane to the world. Charles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
thought of La Clavel&#8217;s desire to dance in Buenos
Aires, for South America. He wondered how
old she was; he had never before considered
her in any connection with age; she had seemed
neither old nor young, but as invested with the
timeless quality of her art. She had spoken often
of her girlhood, but no picture of her as a
girl had formed in his mind. It was conceivable
that, in more stable circumstances, she would
have grown old, become withered with the peculiar
ugliness of aged Spanish women; but that,
too, he could not realize. Somehow, La Clavel&#8217;s
being was her dancing, and what had gone before,
or what might have followed, were irrelevant,
unreal; they were not she. He understood,
now, her protest against being absorbed, involved,
in anything but her profession.</p>
<p>He became conscious of the sustained gravity of
his thoughts, how his activity had been forced
from the body to his mind; and that recalled to
him the necessity for a contrary appearance. It
would be wise for him to go to the Café Dominica
that evening, in an obvious facile excitement at
his connection, at once close and remote, with the
death of Santacilla in the dancer&#8217;s room. But,
beyond the fact that it was known he had dispatched
the servant upstairs, and the usual wild,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
thin speculations, nothing had been allowed to
appear. Santacilla, it was announced, had died
naturally. La Clavel wasn&#8217;t mentioned. She
had spoken to others than Charles of her determination
to go to the Argentine; and it was probable,
rumor said, principally in Spanish mouths,
that she would go quietly south. At the United
States Club, the idlers and gamblers surveyed
Charles with dubious looks; and, over a rum
punch, he adopted a sullen uncommunicative air.
It would not do to drop his widely advertised
habits too suddenly; he could not, in a day,
change from a rake to a serious student of such
books as Machiavelli&#8217;s Prince; and he prepared,
with utter disgust, for his final bow in the cloak
of dissipation.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Purely by accident he met, at the Plaza de
Toros, Jaime Quintara, Remigio Florez and
Andrés. It was so fortunately, evidently, haphazard,
that they continued together while Charles
related the circumstances of the tragedy in La
Clavel&#8217;s room. The others were filled with wonder,
bravos, at her strength and courage. Someday,
Remigio swore, when Cuba was free, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
would put up a monument to her in India
Park. It would be of heroic size, the bronze
figure of a dancer, in a mantón, on a block of
stone, with an appropriate inscription.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble with that,&#8221; Andrés objected, &#8220;is
if we should live and put up a monument to everyone
who deserved it, the parks would be too
crowded with bronzes for walking. All of Cuba
might have to be commemorated in metal.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Neptuno Street and the Paseo Isabel they
parted. Charles proceeded alone toward the sea;
and, with the knowledge that Andrés had not
gone home, but would be evident in public elsewhere,
he stopped to see the other members of the
Escobar family. Carmita Escobar had faded
perceptibly since Vincente&#8217;s death; still riven by
sorrow she ceaselessly regretted the unhappy, the
blasphemous, necessity which made the wearing
of mourning for him inadmissible. Domingo
Escobar, as well, showed the effects of continuous
strain; his vein of humor was exhausted, he no
longer provoked Charles&#8217; inadequate Spanish; he
avoided any direct reference to Cuba. He was,
he said, considering moving to Paris, he was getting
old and no one could complain, now, since&mdash;. He
broke off, evidently at the point of referring
to Vincente and the Escobar local patriotism.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>But Narcisa, Charles was told, had become
promised to Hector Carmache, an admirable gentleman
with large sugar interests; luckily, for
Narcisa, unconnected with any political dreams.</p>
<p>&#8220;She will be very happy,&#8221; her mother proclaimed.</p>
<p>Narcisa narrowed her eyes. &#8220;He lives on an
estancia,&#8221; she added, &#8220;where there will be banana
trees and Haitians to watch; and the conversation
will be about the number of arrobas the
mill grinds.&#8221; She relapsed again into silence;
but, from her lowered countenance, he caught a
quick significant glance toward the balcony.
She rose, presently, and walked out. Charles
gazed at Domingo and Carmita Escobar; they
were sunk in thought, inattentive, and he quietly
joined Narcisa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andrés has told me a great deal about you,&#8221;
she proceeded; &#8220;I made him. He loves you too,
and he says that you are very strong and respected
everywhere. I have had to hear it like that,
for you never come here now. And I hear other
things, too, but from my maid, about the dancer,
La Clavel. You gamble, it seems, and drink as
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>That, he replied, was no more than half true;
it was often necessary for him to appear other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
than he was. He studied her at length: she had
grown more lovely, positively beautiful, in the
past month; the maturity of her engagement to
marry had already intensified her. Narcisa&#8217;s
skirt had been lowered and her hair, which had
hung like a black fan, was tied with a ribbon.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you like me?&#8221; she demanded. But
when he told her very much, she shook her head
in denial. &#8220;I ought to be ashamed,&#8221; she added,
&#8220;but I am not. Did you realize that, when we
were out here before, I made you a proposal?
You ignored it, of course.... I am not ashamed
of what I did then, either. Afterwards, standing
here, I wanted to throw myself to the street;
but, you see, I hadn&#8217;t the courage. It&#8217;s better
now, that time has gone&mdash;I&#8217;ll get fat and frightful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This Carmache,&#8221; Charles Abbott asked,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you like, no, love him?&#8221; She answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;He is, perhaps, fifty&mdash;I am fifteen&mdash;and quite
deaf on one side, I can never remember which;
and he smells like bagasse. I&#8217;ve only seen him
once, for a minute, alone, and then he wanted me
to sit on his knees. I said if he made me I&#8217;d kill
him some night when he was asleep. But he
only laughed and tried to catch me. You should
have heard him breathing; he couldn&#8217;t. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
called me his Carmencita. But, I suppose, I shall
come to forget that, as well. I wanted you to
know all about it; so, when you hear of my marriage,
you will understand what to look for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all very wrong!&#8221; Charles exclaimed.</p>
<p>In reply she said, hurriedly, &#8220;Kiss me.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was wrong, too, he repeated, afterward.
Her warmth and tender fragrance clung to him
like the touch of flower petals. She turned away,
standing at the front of the balcony, her arms,
bare under elbow ruffles, resting on the railing.
The flambeau trees in the Parque Isabel were like
conflagrations. Her head drooped on her slender
neck until it almost rested, despairingly, on
the support before her. &#8220;I hate your northern
way of living,&#8221; her voice was suppressed, disturbingly
mature; &#8220;I hate their bringing you into
the house, only to break my heart. Charles,&#8221;
she laid an appealing hand on his sleeve, &#8220;could
you do this&mdash;help me to run away? We have
cousins in New York who would receive me. If
you could just get me on a steamer!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said decidedly, &#8220;I could not; I
wouldn&#8217;t even if it were possible. What would
Andrés, my friend, think? It would ruin me
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had,&#8221; she admitted, after a little, &#8220;as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
soon as we reached the street, I would have locked
myself about your neck like my crystal beads.
Once when I was supposed to be going with a
servant to the sea baths, I had the quitrin stop at
the San Felipe, and I went up the stair, to the roof,
to your room, but you were out. You see, I am
a very evil girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>He agreed to the extent that she was a very
foolish girl. In turn she studied him carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to have no heart,&#8221; she announced
finally; &#8220;not because you don&#8217;t love me, but in
affairs generally; but I can tell you a secret&mdash;you
have! It&#8217;s as plain as water. What you
think you are&mdash;poof!&#8221; She blew across the open
palm of her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; he returned anxiously. &#8220;But
you are too young, even if you are to be married,
to know about or to discuss such things. As Andrés&#8217;
best friend I must caution you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you kiss me?&#8221; she interrupted.</p>
<p>He was, now, genuinely sorry that he had, but
he replied that it had been no more than the salute
of a brother. &#8220;You had better go in,&#8221; he continued;
&#8220;when they realize we are out here there
will be a stir, perhaps you will be put to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might make a scandal,&#8221; she deliberated,
&#8220;throw myself on you and cry as loudly as possible.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
A smile appeared upon her fresh charming
lips at his expression of dismay. &#8220;Then you
would have to marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have to spank you,&#8221; he retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never speak directly to you again,&#8221;
she concluded; &#8220;so you must remember what
I say, that you are not what you&#8217;d like to
be.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was, he thought, in spite of her loveliness,
a very disagreeable little girl. That designation,
ludicrously inadequate, he forced upon himself.
With a flutter of her skirts she was gone. The
afternoon was so still that he could hear the drilling
of soldiers by the shore, the faint guttural
commands and the concerted grounding of muskets.
Narcisa and her unpleasant prediction
faded from his mind. Standing on the balcony
he imagined a vast concourse gathered below with
upturned faces, waiting for him to speak. He
heard the round periods, the sonorous Spanish, he
delivered, welcoming, in the name of the people,
their newly gained independence, and extending
to them the applause and reassurances of the
United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have won this for yourselves,&#8221; he proclaimed,
&#8220;by your valor and faith and patience;
and no alien, myself least of all, could have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
indispensable to you. What I was privileged to
do was merely to hold together some of the more
inglorious but necessary parts of your struggle;
to bring, perhaps, some understanding, some good
will, from the world outside. You have added
Cuba to the invaluable, the priceless, parts of the
earth where men are free; a deed wrought by the
sacrifice of the best among you. Liberty, as always,
is watered by blood&mdash;&#8221; he hesitated, frowning,
something was wrong about that last phrase,
of, yes&mdash;the watered with blood part; sprinkled,
nourished, given birth in? That last was the
correct, the inevitable, form. The hollow disembodied
voice of the drill sergeant floated up
and then was lost in the beginning afternoon procession
of carriages.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>With a larger boutonnière than he would have
cared to wear at home, a tea rose, he was making
his way through the El Louvre, when Gaspar Arco
de Vaca rose from a gay table and signalled
for him. It was after Retreta, the trade wind
was even more refreshing than customary, and
the spirit of Havana, in the parques and paseos
and restaurants, was high. The Louvre was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
crowded, a dense mass of feminine color against
the white linen of the men, and an animated
chatter, like the bubbles of champagne made
articulate, eddied about the tables laden with
dulces and the cold sweet brightness of ices. He
hesitated, but de Vaca was insistent, and Charles
approached the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think you can remain by yourself,&#8221;
the Spaniard said pleasantly, &#8220;you are mistaken.
For women now, because of the dancer, you are
a figure of enormous interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>He presented Charles to a petulant woman with
a long nose, a seductive mouth, and black hair
low in the French manner; then to a small woman
in a dinner dress everywhere glittering with clear
glass beads, and eyes in which, as he gazed briefly
into them, Charles found bottomless wells of interrogation
and promise. He met a girl to
whom, then, he paid little attention, and a man
past middle age with cropped grey hair on a
uniformly brown head and the gilt floriations of
a general. A place was made for Charles into
which, against his intention, he was forced by a
light insistence. It was, he discovered, beside the
girl; and, because of their proximity, he turned
to her.</p>
<p>At once he recognized that she was unusual,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
strange: he had dismissed her as plain, if not
actually ugly, and that judgment he was forced
to recall. The truth was that she possessed a
rare fascination; but where, exactly, did it lie?
She was, he thought, even younger than Narcisa,
yet, at the same time, she had the balanced calm
of absolute maturity. Then he realized that a
large part of her enigmatic charm came from the
fact that she was, to a marked degree, Chinese.
Her face, evenly, opaquely, pale, was flat, an oval
which held eyes with full, ivory-like lids, narrow
eye brows, a straight small nose and lips heavily
coated with a carmine that failed utterly to disguise
their level strength. Her lustreless hair,
which might have been soot metamorphosed into
straight broad strands, was drawn back severely,
without ornament or visible pins, over her shapely
skull. She wore no jewelry, no gold bands
nor rings nor pendants; and her dress, cut
squarely open at her slim round throat, was the
fragile essence of virginity. She attracted
Charles, although he could think of nothing in
the world to say to her; he was powerless to imagine
what interested her; a girl, she had no flavor
of the conceits of her years; feminine, she was
without the slightest indication of appropriate
sentiments, little facile interests or enthusiasms.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
From time to time she looked at him, he caught
a glimpse of eyes, blue, grey or green, oblique and
disturbing; she said nothing and ate in infinitesimal
amounts the frozen concoction of sapote
before her.</p>
<p>Charles Abbott hadn&#8217;t grasped her name, and
in reply to his further query, she told him in
a low voice that it was Pilar, Pilar de Lima.
Yes, she had been born in Peru. No, she had
never been to China, although she had traveled
as far as Portugal and London. His interest in
her increased, she was so wholly outside his&mdash;any
conceivable&mdash;life; and, without words, in a
manner which defied his analysis, she managed
to convey to him the assurance that he was not impossible
to her.</p>
<p>He found, at intervals, fresh qualities to engage
him: she had unmistakably the ease which
came from the command of money; the pointed
grace of her hands&mdash;for an instant her palm had
sought his&mdash;hid an unexpected firmness; she was
contemptuous of the other vivacious women at the
table; and not a change of expression crossed
the placidity of a countenance no more than a
mask for what, mysterious and not placid, was
back of it. Then, in an undertone during a burst
of conversation, she said, &#8220;I like you.&#8221; She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
half turned from him, in profile, and her lips
had not seemed to move. Seen that way her
nose was minute, the upward twist of her eye
emphasized, her mouth no more than a painted
sardonic curl. She was as slender as a boy of a
race unknown to Charles&mdash;without warmth, without
impulses, fashioned delicately for rooms
hung in peacock silks and courtyards of fretted
alabaster and burnished cedar.</p>
<p>He wanted to reply that he liked her, but, in
prospect, that seemed awkward, banal; and a
lull in the conversation discouraged him. Instead
he examined his feelings in regard to this
Pilar from Lima. It was obvious that she had
nothing in common with the women he had dismissed
from his present and future; she was
more detached, even, than La Clavel on the stage.
And when, abruptly, she began to talk to him, in
an even flow of incomprehensible vowels and sibilants,
he was startled. Gaspar de Vaca spoke
to her in a peremptory tone, and then he addressed
Charles, &#8220;She&#8217;ll hardly say a word in a
Christian tongue, but, when it suits her, she
will sail on in Chinese for a quarter of an hour.
It may be her sense of humor, it may be a prayer,
perhaps what she says, if it could be understood,
would blast your brain, and perhaps she merely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
has a stomach ache.&#8221; But his remonstrance had the
effect designed; and after an <ins title='Was imperturable'>imperturbable</ins> silence,
she said again that she liked Charles Abbott.</p>
<p>The General regretfully pushed back his chair,
rose, and held out an arm in formal gallantry,
and Charles was left to follow with Pilar. She
lingered, while the others went on, and asked him
if, tomorrow, he would take her driving to Los
Molinos. He hesitated, uncertain of the wisdom
of such a proceeding, when her hand again stole
into his. What, anyhow, in the face of that direct
request, could he do but agree? They must
have, she proceeded, since he hadn&#8217;t a private
equipage, the newest quitrin he could procure,
and a calesero more brilliant than any they should
pass on the Calzada de la Reina. After all he
would be but keeping up the useful pretence of his
worldliness; yet, looking forward to the drive
with her, an hour in the scented shade of the Captain-General&#8217;s
gardens, he was aware of an anticipated
pleasure.</p>
<p>The need for caution was reduced to a minimum,
it shrank from existence; naturally he
wouldn&#8217;t talk to Pilar de Lima of politics, he
could not be drawn into the mention of his
friends, of any names connected in the slightest
way with a national independence. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
possible that she had been selected, thrown with
him, for that very purpose; but there his
intelligence, he thought, his knowledge of intrigue, had
been underestimated, insulted. No&mdash;Pilar, de
Vaca, Spain, would gain nothing, and he would
have a very pleasant, an oddly stimulating and
exciting, afternoon. The excitement came from
her extraordinary personality, an intensity tempered
with a remoteness, an indifference, which
he specially enjoyed after the last few
tempestuous days. Being with her resembled floating in
a barge on a fabulous Celestial river between
banks of high green bamboo. It had no
ulterior significance. She was positively inhuman.</p>
<p>He met her, with an impressive glittering carriage
and rider, according to her appointment,
at the end of the Paseo Tacon, past the heat of
afternoon. She was accompanied by a duenna
with rustling silk on a tall gaunt frame, and a
harsh countenance, the upper lip marred by a
bluish shadow, swathed in a heavy black mantilla.
Pilar was exactly the same as she had been
the evening before. The diminished but still
bright day showed no flaw on the evenness of her
pallor, the artificial carmine of her lips was like
the applied petals of a geranium, her narrow
sexless body was upright in its film of clear white.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>The older woman was assisted into the leather
body of the quitrin, Pilar settled lightly in the
niña bonita, Charles mounted to the third place,
the calesero swung up on the horse outside the
shafts, and they rattled smartly into the Queen&#8217;s
Drive. From where he sat he could see nothing
but the sombre edge of the mantilla beside him
and Pilar&#8217;s erect back, her long slim neck which
gave her head, her densely arranged hair, an appearance
of too great weight. On either side the
fountains and glorietas, the files of close-planted
laurel trees, whirled behind them. The
statue of Carlos III gave way to the Jardin
Botánico.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There he commanded the carriage to halt, and,
in reply to Pilar&#8217;s surprise, explained that he was
following the established course. &#8220;We leave the
quitrin here, and it meets us at the gates of the
Quinta, and meanwhile we walk. There are a
great many paths and flowers.&#8221; On the ground
she admitted her ignorance of Havana, and, followed
at a conventional distance by her companion,
they entered the Gardens. There was a
warm perfumed steam of watered blossoming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
plants and exotic trees; and Charles chose a way
that brought them into an avenue of palms,
through which the fading sunlight fell in diagonal
bands, to a wide stone basin where water lilies
spread their curd-like whiteness. There they
paused, and Pilar sat on the edge of the pool,
with one hand dipping in the water. He saw
that, remarkably, she resembled a water lily
bloom, she was as still, as densely pale; and he
told her this in his best manner. But if it
pleased her he was unable to discover. A hundred
feet away from them the chaperone cast her
replica on the unstirred surface of the water, in
the middle of which a fountain of shells maintained
a cool splashing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like one of those,&#8221; she said, indicating
a floating flower.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too far out,&#8221; he responded, and she turned
her slow scrutiny upon him. Her eyes were
neither blue nor gray but green, the green of a
stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you are agreeable is more important
than you know,&#8221; she said deliberately. &#8220;And de
Vaca&mdash;&#8221; she conveyed a sense of disdain.
&#8220;What is it that he wants so much from you?
How can it, on this little island, a place with only
two cities, be important? I must tell you that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
am not cheap; and when I was brought here, to
see a boy, it annoyed me. But I am annoyed no
longer,&#8221; her wet fingers swiftly left their prints
on his cheek. &#8220;Oporto and the English Court&mdash;I
understood that; but to dig secrets from you, an
innocent young American,&#8221; she relapsed into silence
as though he, the subject she had introduced,
were insufficient to excuse the clatter of speech.
So far as he was concerned, he replied, he had
no idea of her meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he went on more volubly, &#8220;I was,
to some extent, connected with the death of Santacilla,
an officer of the regiment of Isabel, and
they may still be looking for information about
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She assured him he was wrong. &#8220;It is Cuba
that troubles them. It&#8217;s in their heads you are
close to powerful families here and in North
America, and that you are bringing them together,
pouring Northern gold into the empty pockets of
the Revolution. I saw at once, before I met you,
that I should waste my time, and I was going
away at once ... until you walked into the restaurant.
Now it will amuse me, and I shall take
the doblons I get and buy you a present, a ruby,
and, when you see Captain de Vaca, you will wear
it and smile and he will know nothing.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t buy me anything,&#8221; Charles protested
earnestly; &#8220;I can at least understand that,
how generous you are. If you are unfamiliar
with Cuba perhaps you will let me inform you.
I came to Havana, you see, for my lungs. They
were bad, and now they are good; and that is my
history here. There is no hole in them because
I have been careful to avoid the troubles on the
street; and the way to miss them is not to give
them an admission. The reason I am here with
you is because you seemed to me, in yourself, so
far away from all that. Your mind might be in
China.&#8221; He went on to make clear to her his
distrust of women. &#8220;But you are different; you
are like a statue that has come to life, a very
lovely statue. What you really are doesn&#8217;t matter,
I don&#8217;t care, I shall never know. But a
water lily&mdash;that is enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you wise or no deeper than this?&#8221; she
asked, indicating the shallow fountain. &#8220;But
don&#8217;t answer; how, as you say, can it affect us?
You are you and I am I. We might even love
each other with no more; that would be best&mdash;it
is the more that spoils love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>But, relapsing into immobility, she ignored his
question. Beyond doubt his interest in her had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
increased; it was an attraction without name, yet
none the less potent. Seated close beside him
she still seemed to be fashioned from a vital material
other than flesh and blood; she was like a
creation of sheer magic ... for what end?
They rose, leaving the Botanical Gardens, the
spotted orchids and air plants and oleanders, for
the Quinta. There they passed into a walk completely
arched over with the bushes of the Mar
Pacifico, the rose of the Pacific, a verdurous tunnel
of leaves and broad fragrant pink blooms,
with a farther glimpse of a cascade over mossy
rocks.</p>
<p>The stream entered a canal, holding some gaily
painted and cushioned row boats, and a green-gold
flotilla of Mandarin ducks. There were
aviaries of doves, about which strollers were gathered,
and a distant somnolent military guard.
It was the first time for weeks that Charles had
been consciously relaxed, submerged in an unguarded
pleasure of being. Pilar might be honest
about de Vaca and his purpose, or she might
be covering something infinitely more cunning.
It would bring her nothing! The very simplicity
of his relationship with her was a complete
protection; he had no impulse to be serious, nothing
in his conversation to guard.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>Pilar seemed <ins title='Was singuarly'>singularly</ins> young here, engaged in
staring at and fingering the flowers, reading the
sign boards that designated the various pleasances&mdash;the
Wood of the Princess, the Garden of
San Antonio, the Queen&#8217;s Glade. Her tactile
curiosity was insatiable, she trailed her sensitive
hands over every strange surface that offered.
Then, with her airy skirt momentarily caught on
a spear of bearded grass, he saw, below her knee,
under the white stocking, the impression of a
blade, narrow and wicked. La Clavel had carried
a knife in that manner, many women, he had
no doubt, did; but in Pilar its stealthy subdued
gleam affected him unpleasantly. It presented a
sharp mocking contrast to all that, in connection
with her, had been running happily through his
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were a moth, soft and white,&#8221;
he told her; &#8220;but it appears that you are a wasp
in disguise&mdash;I hope it won&#8217;t occur to you to sting
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Serenely she resettled her skirt. &#8220;Did you
look for a scapular? Young men&#8217;s eyes should
be on the sky.&#8221; Then she put an arm through
his. &#8220;It was never there for you ... a moth
soft and white. But I don&#8217;t care for that.&#8221; Her
gliding magnetic touch again passed, like the fall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
of a leaf, over his cheek. Affecting not to notice
it he lighted a thin cigar; he&#8217;d have to watch
Pilar de Lima. Or was it himself who needed
care? The feeling of detachment, of security,
was pierced by a more acute emotion, a sensation
that resembled the traced point of her knife. She
asked, nearing the place where they were to meet
the quitrin, when she might see him again; and
mechanically he suggested that evening, after
the music in the Plaza de Armas.</p>
<p>Returning to Ancha del Norte Street, his face
was grave, almost concerned, but he was made
happy by finding Andrés Escobar in his room.
Andrés, with the window shades lowered, was
lounging and smoking in his fine cambric shirt
sleeves. He had a business of routine to communicate,
and then he listened, censoriously, to
Charles&#8217; account of his afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a little devil, of course, with her gartered
steel, but she amuses me. I have the
shadow of an idea that she was truthful about
de Vaca; and the ruby would be an excellent
joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot approve of any of this,&#8221; Andrés decided;
&#8220;it has so many hidden possibilities&mdash;the
Spaniards are so hellish cunning. To be candid
with you, I can&#8217;t understand why they have neglected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
you so long. You are, Charles, fairly conspicuous.
Perhaps it is because they hope, in the
end, to get information from you. In that case,
if we were in danger, I would shoot you with my
own hand. Drop this Chinese water lily; their
stems are always in the mud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, you must see her,&#8221; Charles
Abbott insisted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve explained that she can&#8217;t
hurt us; and we may get something floated the
other way.&#8221; He was aware of an indefinable
resentment at Andrés&#8217; attitude: his love for him
was all that prevented the acerbity of a voiced
irritation.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Yet, when the regimental band was leaving to
the diminishing strains of its quickstep, Andrés
joined Charles and Pilar&mdash;who had left her quitrin&mdash;strolling
through the Plaza. As usual she
said practically nothing; but, in the gloom, she
was specially potent, like a fascinating and ironic
idol to innocence; and Charles Abbott was pleased
by Andrés&#8217; instant attention. Pilar was reluctant,
now, to return to the carriage, and she lingered
between the men, who, in turn, gazed down
addressing remarks to the smooth blackness of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
her hair or to the immobile whiteness of her
face. Charles dropped behind, to light a cigar,
and when he came up to them again he had the
illusive sense of a rapid speech stopped at his
approach. Andrés Escobar&#8217;s countenance was
lowered, his brow drawn together ... it had
been Pilar de Lima, surprisingly, who had talked.
Charles recalled the manner in which her low,
even voice flowed from scarcely moving lips, with
never a shadow of emotion, of animation, across
her unstirred flattened features.</p>
<p>Some Cubans gathered about the table when,
later, they were eating ices; and, gaining Pilar&#8217;s
consent, he left with the indispensable polite regrets
and bows. He was vaguely and thoroughly
disturbed, uneasy, as though a grain of poison
had entered him and were circulating through
all his being. It was a condition he was unfamiliar
with, disagreeable in the extreme; and one
which he determined to stamp out. It hadn&#8217;t
existed in his contact with Pilar until the appearance
of Andrés; yes, it came about from the conjunction
of the girl, Andrés and himself; spilled
into the clarity of their companionship, Andrés
and his, her influence had already darkened
and slightly embittered it ... had affected it,
Charles added; she was powerless to touch him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
in the future; he put her resolutely, completely,
from his thoughts.</p>
<p>He was a little appalled at the suddenness with
which the poison had tainted him, infecting every
quality of superiority, of detachment, of reasoning,
he possessed. When he saw Andrés again,
after the interval of a week, his heart was empty
of everything but crystal admiration, affection;
but Andrés was obscured, his bearing even defiant.
They were at a reception given by a connection
of the Cespedes on the Cerro. Instinctively
they had drawn aside, behind a screen of
pomegranate and mignonette trees in the patio;
but their privacy, Charles felt, had been uncomfortably
invaded. He spoke of this, gravely, and
Andrés suddenly drooped in extreme dejection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you ever bring us together!&#8221; he
exclaimed. &#8220;She, Pilar, has fastened herself
about me like one of those pale strangling orchids.
No other woman alive could have troubled
me, but, then, Pilar is not a woman.&#8221;
Charles Abbott explained his agreement with that.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is she?&#8221; Andrés cried. &#8220;She says nothing,
she hardly ever lifts her eyes from her
hands, I can give you my word kissing her is
like tasting a sherbet; and yet I can&#8217;t put her
out of my mind. I get all my thoughts, my feelings,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
from her as though they passed in a body
from her brain to mine. They are thoughts
I detest. Charles, when I am away from you,
I doubt and question you, and sink into an
indifference toward all we are, all we have
been.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something like that began to happen to me,&#8221;
Charles admitted; &#8220;it was necessary to bring it
to an end; just as you must. Such things are
not for us. Drop her, Andrés, on the Paseo,
where she belongs.&#8221; The other again slipped
outside the bounds of their friendship. &#8220;I
must ask you to make no such allusion,&#8221; he retorted
stiffly. Charles laughed, &#8220;You old idiot,&#8221;
he said affectionately, &#8220;have her and get over it,
then, as soon as possible; I won&#8217;t argue with you
about such affairs, that&#8217;s plain.&#8221; Andrés laid
a gripping hand on his arm, avoiding, while he
spoke, Charles&#8217; searching gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one thing you can do for me,&#8221; he
hurried on, &#8220;and&mdash;and I beg you not to refuse.
The mantón that belonged to La Clavel! I described
it to Pilar, and she is mad to wear it to
the danzón at the Tacon Theatre. You see, it
was embroidered by the Chinese, and it is appropriate
for her. Think of Pilar in that
shawl, Charles.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t have it,&#8221; he answered shortly.</p>
<p>Andrés Escobar&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;It had occurred
to me you might refuse,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Then there is nothing for me to do. But it
surprises me, when I remember the circumstances,
that you have such a tender feeling for it. After
all, it wasn&#8217;t a souvenir of love; you never lost
an opportunity to say how worn you were with
La Clavel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Andrés, it isn&#8217;t a token of love, but a banner,
yours even more than mine, a charge we must
keep above the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>That, Andrés observed satirically, was very
pretty; but a mantón, a woman&#8217;s thing, had no
relation to the cause of Cuban independence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, but of course, you are right,&#8221; Charles
agreed. &#8220;Very well, then it is only a superstition
of mine. I have the feeling that if we lower
this&mdash;this standard it will bring us bad luck, it
will be disastrous. What that Pilar, you may
think, is to you, the mantón has always been for
me. It is in my blood; I regard it as a sailor
might a chart. And then, Andrés, remember&mdash;it
protected Cuba.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to have it,&#8221; the other whispered
desperately; &#8220;she&mdash;she wants it, for the danzón.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>Charles Abbott&#8217;s resentment changed to pity,
and then to a calm acceptance of what had the aspect
of undeviating fate. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said
quietly. &#8220;After all, you are right, it is nothing
but a shawl, and our love for each other must not
suffer. I&#8217;ll give it to you freely, Andrés: she
will look wonderful in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other grasped his hands. &#8220;Be patient,
Charles,&#8221; he begged. &#8220;This will go and leave
us as we were before, as we shall always be. It
hasn&#8217;t touched what you know of, it is absolutely
aside from that&mdash;a little scene in front of the curtain
between the acts of the serious, the main,
piece. I doubted her honesty, as you described
it, at first; but you were right. She has no interest
at all in our small struggle; she is only
anxious to return to Peru.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish she had never come from there!&#8221;
Charles declared; &#8220;whether she is honest or dishonest
is unimportant. She is spoiled, like a
bad lime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had been more successful with her&mdash;&#8221;
Andrés paused significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that,&#8221; Charles returned, &#8220;is what she said
or hinted to you!&#8221; Andrés Escobar was gazing
away into the massed and odorous grey-blue mignonette.
&#8220;Go away before I get angry with you;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
you are more Spanish than any Mendoza. The
mantón you&#8217;ll find at home tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was, frankly, worried about Andrés; not
fundamentally&mdash;Andrés&#8217; loyalty was beyond any
personal betrayal&mdash;but because he was aware of
the essential inflammability of all tropical emotion.
The other might get into a rage with Pilar,
who never, herself, could fall into such an error,
and pay the penalty exacted by a swift gesture
toward the hem of her skirt. Then he recalled,
still with a slight shudder of delight, the soft
dragging feel of her fingers on his cheek. He
tied the shawl up sombrely, oppressed by the
conviction of mischance he had expressed to Andrés,
and despatched it.</p>
<p>Pilar de Lima might, possibly, depart for Peru
earlier even than she hoped; boats left not infrequently
for Mexico and South America&mdash;the
Argentine for which La Clavel had longed&mdash;and
she was welcome to try her mysterious arts upon
the seas away from Cuba and Andrés. A sugar
bag could easily, at the appropriate moment, be
slipped over her head, and a bateau carry her
out, with a sum of gold, at night to a departing
ship. There would be no trouble, after she had
been seen, in getting her on board. And Charles
Abbott thought of her, in her silent whiteness, corrupting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
one by one the officers and crew; a vague
hatred would spread over the deck, forward and
aft; and through the cabins, the hearts, her suggestions
and breath of evil touched. They would
never see Mexico, he decided; but, on a calm
purple night in the Gulf, a sanguine and volcanic
inferno of blackened passion would burst
around the flicker of her blanched dress and face
no colder in death than in life.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Charles Abbott&#8217;s thoughts returned continually
to Andrés; in the shadowy region of his brain the
latter was like a vividly and singly illuminated
figure. He remembered, too, the occasion of his
first seeing Andrés, at the Hotel Inglaterra: they
had gone together into the restaurant, where, over
rum punches and cigars, the love he had for him
had been born at once. It was curious&mdash;that
feeling; a thing wholly immaterial, idealizing.
He had speculated about it before, but without
coming to the end of its possibilities, the bottom
of its meaning. There was no need to search for
a reason for the love of women; that, it might be,
was no more than mechanical, the allurement cast
by nature about its automatic purpose. It belonged
to earth, where it touched any sky was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
Charles&#8217; concern; but his friendship for Andrés
Escobar had no relation to material ends.</p>
<p>At first it had been upheld, vitalized, by admiration,
qualities perceptible to his mind, to
analysis; he had often reviewed them&mdash;Andrés&#8217;
deep sense of honor, his allegiance to a conduct
free of self, his generosity, his slightly dramatic
but inflexible courage, the fastidious manners of
his person. His clothes, the sprig of mimosa
he preferred, the angle of his hat and the rake
back, through an elbow, of his malacca cane, were
all satisfying, distinguished. But Charles&#8217; consciousness
of these actual traits, details, had vanished
before an acceptance of Andrés as a whole,
uncritically. What, once, had been a process of
thought had become an emotion integral with his
own subconscious being.</p>
<p>Something of his essential character had entered
Andrés, and a part of Andrés had become
bound into him. This, as soon as she had grown
into the slightest menace to it, had cast Pilar de
Lima from his consideration. It had been no
effort, at the moment necessary he had forgotten
her; just as Andrés, faced with the truth, would
put her away from him. The bond between them,
Charles told himself, was forged from pure gold.</p>
<p>This was running through his head on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
night of the danzón. He was seated at the entrance
of the United States Club, where the
sharp Yankee accents of the gamblers within
floated out and were lost in the narrow walled
darkness of Virtudes Street. It was no more than
eleven, the Tacon Theatre would be empty
yet.... Charles had no intention of going to
the danzón, but at the same time he was the victim
of a restless curiosity in connection with it;
he had an uncomfortable oppression at the vision
of Andrés, with Pilar in the bright shawl, on
the floor crowded with the especial depravities of
Havana.</p>
<p>The Spanish officers had made it customary
for men of gentility to go into the criolla festivities;
they were always present, the young and
careless, the drunken and degenerate; and that,
too, added to Charles&#8217; indefinable sense of possible
disaster. In a way, it might be an excellent
thing for him to attend, to watch, the danzón. If
Andrés were infatuated he would be blind to the
dangers, both the political and those emanating
from the mixture of bloods. At this moment the
game inside ended, and a knot of men, sliding
into their coats, awkwardly grasping broad-brimmed
hats, appeared, departing for the Tacon
Theatre. A perfunctory nodded invitation for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
him to accompany them settled the indecision in
Charles Abbott&#8217;s mind. And, a half hour later,
he was seated in a palco of the second tier, above
the dance.</p>
<p>Familiar with them, he paid no attention to the
sheer fantastic spectacle; the two orchestras, one
taking up the burden of sound when the other
paused, produced not for him their rasping
dislocated rhythm. He was aware only of floating
skirts, masks and dark or light faces, cigars
held seriously in serious mouths. Charles soon
saw that Andrés and Pilar de Lima had not yet
arrived. As he leaned forward over the railing
of the box, Gaspar Arco de Vaca, sardonic and
observing, glanced up and saluted with his exaggerated
courtesy. He disappeared, there was
a knock at the closed door behind Charles, and
de Vaca entered.</p>
<p>There was a general standing acknowledgement
of his appearance; the visor of his dress
cap was touched for every man present, and he
took a vacated chair at Charles&#8217; side. &#8220;You
weren&#8217;t attracted to my white absinthe,&#8221; he said
easily. On the contrary, Charles replied, he had
liked Pilar very well, although she had annoyed
him by foolish tales of a Spanish interest in him.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is, of course, an agent,&#8221; de Vaca admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
indifferently. &#8220;We almost have to keep
her in a cage, like a leopard from Tartary. She
has killed three officers of high rank; although
we do not prefer her as an assassin. She is valuable
as a drop of acid, here, there; and extraordinary
individuals often rave about her. We&#8217;ll
have to garrotte her some time, and that will be
a pity.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a flash of color below, of carmine
and golden orange, and Charles recognized Pilar
wrapped, from her narrow shoulders to her delicate
ankles, in the mantón. Andrés Escobar,
with a protruding lip and sullen eyes, was at her
side. Suddenly de Vaca utterly astounded
Charles; with a warning pressure of his hand he
spoke at the younger man&#8217;s ear:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am leaving at once for Madrid, a promotion
has fortunately lifted me from this stinking
black intrigue, and I have a memory ... from
the sala de Armas, the echo of a sufficiently spirited
compliment. As I say, I am off; what is
necessary to you is necessary&mdash;a death in Havana
or a long life at home. Where I am concerned
you have bought your right to either.
You cannot swing the balance against Spain.
And I have this for you to consider. Your
friend, Escobar, has reached the end of his journey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
It will accomplish nothing to inform him;
he is not to walk from the theatre. Very well&mdash;if
you wish to hatch your seditious wren&#8217;s eggs
tomorrow, if you wish to wake tomorrow at all,
stay away from him. Anything else will do no
good except, perhaps, for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Abbott sat with a mechanical gaze on
the floor covered with revolving figures. He
realized instantly that Gaspar Arco de Vaca had
been truthful. The evidence of that lay in the
logic of his words, the ring of his voice. The
officer rose, saluted, and left. Andrés had come
to the end of his journey! It was incredible.
He had not moved from the spot where Charles
had first seen him; he had taken off his hat, and
his dark faultlessly brushed hair held in a smooth
gleam the reflection of a light.</p>
<p>Andrés turned with a chivalrous gesture to
Pilar, who, ignoring it completely, watched with
inscrutable eyes the passing men. The shawl, on
her, had lost its beauty; it was malevolent,
screaming in color; contrasted with it her face
was marble. How, Charles speculated desperately,
was Andrés to be killed? And then he
saw. A tall young Spaniard with a jeering countenance,
in the uniform of a captain in a regiment
not attached at Havana, stopped squarely,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
with absolute impropriety, before Pilar and asked
her to dance. Andrés Escobar, for the moment,
was too amazed for objection; and, as Pilar was
borne away, he made a gesture of denial that was
too late.</p>
<p>He glanced around, as though to see if anyone
had observed his humiliation; and Charles Abbott
instinctively drew back into the box. As he
did this he cursed himself with an utter loathing.
Every natural feeling impelled him below, to go
blindly to the support of Andrés. There must
be some way&mdash;a quick shifting of masks and escape
through a side door&mdash;to get him safely out
of the hands of Spain. This, of course, would
involve, endanger, himself, but he would welcome
the necessity of that acceptance. Gaspar de
Vaca had indicated the price he might well pay
for such a course&mdash;the end, at the same time, of
himself; not only the death of his body but the
ruin of his hopes and high plans. Nothing, he
had told himself a thousand times, should be allowed
to assail them. Indeed, he had discussed
just such a contingency as this with Andrés.
Theoretically there had been no question of
the propriety of an utter seeming selfishness;
the way, across a restaurant table, had been
clear.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>In the box the other Americans maintained a
steady absorbed commenting on the whirling
color of the danzón. One, finally, attracted by
the mantón on Pilar de Lima, called the attention
of the others to her Chinese characteristics.
They all leaned forward, engaged by the total
pallor of her immobility above the blazing silk.
They exclaimed when she left the Spanish officer
and resumed her place by Andrés Escobar&#8217;s side.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that peculiar?&#8221; Charles was asked. &#8220;You
are supposed to know all about these dark affairs.
Isn&#8217;t it understood that the women keep to their
own men? And that Cuban, Abbott, you know
him; we often used to see you with him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Charles Abbott acknowledged, &#8220;partners
seldom leave each other. That is Andrés
Escobar.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paid no more heed to the voices about him,
but sat with his gaze, his hopes and fears, fastened
on Andrés and Pilar. Back again, she
was, as usual, silent, dragging her fingers through
the knotted magenta fringe of the shawl. Andrés,
though, was speaking in short tense phrases
that alternated with concentrated angry pauses.
She lifted her arms to him, and they began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
dance. They remained, however, characteristic
of the danzón, where they were, turning slowly
and reversing in a remarkably small space.
They were a notably graceful couple, and they
varied, with an intricate stepping, the general
monotony of the measure.</p>
<p>Charles had an insane impulse to call down to
Andrés, to attract his attention, and to wave him
away from the inimical forces gathering about
him. Instead of this he lighted a cigarette, with
hands the reverse of steady, and concentrated all
his thoughts upon the fact of Cuban independence.
That, he told himself, was the only thing
of importance in his life, in the world. And it
wasn&#8217;t Cuba&mdash;alone, but the freedom of life at
large, that rested, in part at least, on the foundation
he might help to lay, the beginning solidity
of human liberty, superiority. He forced himself
to gaze with an air of indifference at the dancing
below him; but, it seemed, wherever he looked,
the mantón floated into his vision. He saw,
now, nothing else, neither Pilar nor Andrés, but
only the savage challenging fire of silks. The
shawl&#8217;s old familiar significance had been entirely
lost&mdash;here he hated and feared it, it was
synonymous with all that threatened his success.
It gathered into its folded and draped square the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
evil of the danzón, the spoiled mustiness of joined
and debased bloods, the license under a grotesque
similitude of restraint.</p>
<p>This was obliterated by a wave of affection for
Andrés so strong that it had the effect of an intolerable
physical pressure within his body: his
love had the aspect of a tangible power bound to
assert itself or to destroy him. With clenched
hands he fought it back, he drove it away before
the memory of the other. Voices addressed him,
but he paid no attention, the words were mere
sounds from a casual sphere with which he had
nothing in common. He must succeed in his endeavor,
put into actuality at this supreme moment
his selfless projection of duty, responsibility.
For it was, in spite of his preoccupation
with its personal possibilities, an ideal to which
he, as an entity, was subordinated. He recalled
the increasing number of destinies in which he
was involved, that were being thrust upon him,
and for which, at best, he would become accountable.
So much more lay in the immediate future
than was promised&mdash;justified&mdash;in the present.</p>
<p>Here, too, Andrés was at fault&mdash;precisely the
accident had happened to him that he was so
strict in facing for others. His absorption
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
wouldn&#8217;t, as an infatuation, continue; or, rather,
it could not have lasted ... long. But already
it had been long enough to finish, to kill, Andrés.
Charles rose uncontrollably to his feet; he would
save his friend from the menace of the whole
Spanish army. But de Vaca, whose every accent
carried conviction, had been explicit: he particularly
would not have spoken under any other
circumstance. He had, in reality, been tremendously
flattering in depending to such a degree on
Charles&#8217; coolness and intellect. Gaspar de Vaca
would have taken no interest in a sentimentalist.
The officer without question had found in
Charles Abbott a strain of character, a resolution,
which he understood, approved; to a certain extent
built on. He had, in effect, concluded that
Charles and himself would act similarly in similar
positions.</p>
<p>It was, Charles decided, at an end; he must go
on as he had begun. A strange numb species of
calm settled over him. The vast crowded floor,
the boxes on either hand, sweeping tier on tier to
the far hidden ceiling, surrounding the immense
chandelier glittering with crystal lustres, were
all removed, distant, from him. The Tacon
Theatre took on the appearance of a limitless pit
into which all human life had been poured, arbitrarily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
thrown together, and, in the semblance of
masquerading gaiety, made to whirl in a time
that had in its measure the rattle of bones, a
drumming on skulls. This conception sickened
him, he could, he felt, no longer breathe in a
closeness which he imagined as fetid; and Charles
realized that, at least, there was no need for him
to remain. Indeed, it would be better in every
way to avoid the impending, the immediate,
catastrophe.</p>
<p>With a hasty incoherent remark he secured his
hat and left the box. Outside, in the bare corridor,
he paused and his lips automatically
formed the name Andrés Escobar. In a flash he
saw the gathering disintegration of the Escobar
family&mdash;Vincente dead, his body dishonored;
Narcisa, ineffable, flower-like, sacrificed to dull
ineptitude; Domingo, who had been so cheerfully
round, furrowed with care, his spirit dead before
his body; Carmita sorrowing; and Andrés, Andrés
the beautiful, the young and proud, betrayed,
murdered in a brawl at a negro dance. What disaster!
And where, in the power of accomplishment,
they had failed, where, fatally, they had
been vulnerable, was at their hearts, in their love
each for the other, or in the fallibility of such an
emotion as Andrés felt for Pilar. He, Charles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
Abbott, must keep free from that entanglement.
This reassurance, however, was not new; all the
while it had supported him.</p>
<p>He made his way down the broad shallow steps,
passing extraordinary figures&mdash;men black and
twisted like the carvings of roots in the garb of
holiday minstrels; women coffee-colored and
lovely like Jobaba, their faces pearly with rice
powder, in yellow satin or black or raw purple,
their feet in high-heeled white kid slippers.
Where they stood in his way he brushed them unceremoniously,
hastily, aside, and he was followed
by low threatening murmurs, witless laughter.
A man, loyal to the Cuban cause, attempted to
stop him, to repeat something which, he assured
Charles, was of grave weight; but he went on
heedlessly.</p>
<p>His passage became, against his reasoning
mind, a flight; and he cursed, with an unbalanced
rage, in a minor frenzy, when he saw that he
would have to walk through a greater part of the
body of the theatre before he could escape. The
dancers had, momentarily, thinned out, and he
went directly across the floor. There was a flame
before his eye, the illusion of a shifting screen
of blood; and he found himself facing Pilar de
Lima and Andrés; beyond, the Spanish officer, tall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
and lank and young, was peering at them with
an aggressive spite. Charles turned aside, avoiding
the tableau. Then he heard Andrés&#8217; exasperated
voice ordering the girl to come with him to
the promenade. Instead of that her glimmering
eyes, with lights like the reflection of polished
green stones, evading Andrés, sought and found
the officer.</p>
<p>Charles Abbott&#8217;s legs were paralysed, he was
held stationary, as though he were helpless in a
dream. His heart pounded and burned, and a
great strangling impulse shook him like a flag in
the wind. &#8220;Andrés!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;Andrés, let her
go, she is nothing! Quickly, before it is too late.
Remember&mdash;&#8221; There was a surging concentration
so rapid that Charles saw it as a constricting
menace rather than the offensive of a group of
men. Pilar stooped, her hand at her knee.
Charles threw an arm about Andrés, but he was
dragged, struggling, away. She was icy in the
hell of the mantón. There was a suspension of
breathing, of sound, through which a fragile hand
with a knife searched and searched. Then a
shocking blow fell on Charles Abbott&#8217;s head and
the Tacon Theatre rocked and collapsed in darkness.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>The sharp closing of a door brought him, a
man advanced in middle age, abruptly to his feet.
He was confused, and swayed dizzily, with out-stretched
arms as though he were grasping vainly
for the dissolving fragments of a shining mirage
of youth. They left him, forever, and he stood
regaining his strayed sense of immediacy. He
was surprisingly weary, in a gloom made evident
by the indirect illumination of an arc light across
and farther up the street. Fumbling over the
wall he encountered the light switch, and flooded
his small drawing-room with brilliance. The
clock on the mantle, crowned by an eagle with
lifted gilded wings, pointed to the first quarter
past eleven: when he had sunk into his abstraction
from the present, wandered back into the
sunlight of Havana and his days of promise, it
had been no more than late afternoon; and now
Mrs. Vauxn and her daughter, his neighbors, had
returned from their dinner engagement. He
wondered, momentarily, why that hour and ceremony
had passed unattended for him, and then
recalled that Bruton and his wife, who kept his
house, had gone to the funeral of a relative, leaving
on the dining-room table, carefully covered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
some cuts of cold meat, a salad of lettuce, bran
bread and fresh butter, and the coffee percolator
with its attachment for a plug in the floor.</p>
<p>To the rest, he had faithfully told Mrs. Bruton,
who was severe with him, he&#8217;d attend. In place
of that he had wandered into an amazing memory
of his beginning manhood. The beginning,
he told himself, and, in many ways the end&mdash;since
then he had done little or nothing. After
the ignominy of his deportation from Cuba&mdash;impending
satisfactory negotiations between the
United States and Spain, he gathered later, had
preserved him from the dignity of political martyrdom&mdash;a
drabness of life had caught him from
which he could perceive no escape. Not, he
was bound to add, that he had actively looked for
one. No, his participation in further events had
been interfered with by a doubt, his life had been
drawn into an endless question. If he had
walked steadily past Andrés Escobar, left him to
a murder which, after all, he, Charles Abbott,
had been powerless to stop, would he have gone
on to the triumph of his ideal?</p>
<p>In addition to this there was the eternal speculation
over the relation, in human destiny, of the
heart to the head&mdash;which, in the end, would, must,
triumph? There was no necessity in his final
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
philosophy for the optimism, where men are concerned,
that had been his first stay. He wasn&#8217;t
so sure now&mdash;but was he certain of anything?&mdash;of
the coming victory of right, of the spreading,
from land to land, of freedom. Did life reach
upward or down, or was it merely the circling of
a carrousel, the whirling of the danzón? Nothing,
for him, could be settled, definite. He was
inclined to the belief that the blow of the scabbard
on his head.... That, however, like the
rest, was indeterminate. He came back eternally
to the same query&mdash;had he, as for so long, so
wearily, he had insisted to himself, failed, proved
weak for the contentions of existence on a positive
plane? Had he become a part, a member,
of the nameless, the individually impotent,
throng? His sympathies were, by birth, aristocratic
rather than humane; he preferred strength
to acquiescence; but there were times now, perhaps,
when he was aging, when there was a relief
in sinking into the sea of humility.</p>
<p>Then his thoughts centered again on Howard
Gage; who, before leaving that afternoon, had
unpleasantly impressed Charles Abbott by his inelasticity,
the fixity of his gaze upon the ground.
Howard had been involved in a war of a magnitude
that swamped every vestige of the long-sustained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
Cuban struggle. And he admitted his
relation to this had been one of bitter necessity:</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to go, we all did,&#8221; Howard Gage had
said. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any music about it, any
romance. It had to be done, that was all, and
it was. Don&#8217;t expect me to be poetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, the youth of today were, to Charles&#8217; way
of thinking, badly off. Anyone who could not
be poetic, who wouldn&#8217;t be if he had the chance,
was unfortunate, limited, cramped. Visions,
ideals, were indispensable for youth. Why,
damn it, love was dependent on dreams, unreality.
He had never known it; but he was able to appreciate
what it might be in a man&#8217;s life. He
no longer scorned love, or the woman he was able
to imagine&mdash;a tender loveliness never out of a
slightly formal beauty. For her the service parts
of the house would have no existence; and,
strangely, he gave no consideration to children.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that he minded loneliness; that was
not an unmixed evil, especially for a man whose
existence was chiefly spun from memories, speculations,
and conditioned by the knowledge that
he had had the best of life, its fullest measure, at
the beginning. He had never again seen a
woman like La Clavel, a friend who could compare
with Andrés, wickedness such as Pilar&#8217;s,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
days and players as brilliant as those of Havana
before, well&mdash;before he had passed fifty. If the
trade winds still blew, tempering the
magnificence of the Cuban nights, they no longer blew
for him. But Havana, as well, had changed.</p>
<p>The piano next door took up, where it had been
dropped, the jota from Liszt&#8217;s Rhapsody Espagnol.
It rippled and sang for a moment and
then ended definitely for the night. Other dancers,
Charles reasonably supposed, continued the
passionate art of that lyric passage; he read of
them, coming from Spain to the United States for
no other purpose. He had no doubt about their
capability, and no wish to see them. They would
do for Howard Gage. What if he, instead of
Charles Abbott, had been at the Tacon Theatre
the night Andrés had died? That was an interesting
variation of the old question&mdash;what, in
his predicament, would Howard Gage have
done? Walked away, probably, holding his
purpose undamaged! But Andrés could never
have loved Howard Gage; Andrés, for his attachment,
required warmth, intensity, the ornamental
forms of honor; poetry, briefly. That lost romantic
time, that day in immaculate white linen
with a spray of mimosa in its buttonhole!</p>
<p>There were some flowers, Charles recalled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
standing on the table in the hall, dahlias; and he
walked out and drew one into the lapel of his
coat. It was without scent, just as, now, life was
unscented; yet, surveying himself in the mirror
over the vase, he saw that the sombreness of his
attire was lightened by the spot of red. Nothing,
though, could give vividness to his countenance,
that was dry and dull, scored with lines that resembled
traces of dust. The moustache across
his upper lip was faded and brittle. It was of
no account; if he had lacked ultimately the
courage, the stamina, to face and command life,
he was serene at the threat of death.</p>
<p>Suddenly hungry, he went into the dining-room
and removed the napkins, turned the electricity
into the percolator. Then, with a key
from under the edge of the cloth on a console-table,
he opened a door of the sideboard, and
produced a tall dark bottle of Marquis de Riscal
wine, and methodically drew the cork. Charles
Abbott wiped the glass throat and, seated, poured
out a goblet full of the translucent crimson liquid.
It brought a slight flush to his cheeks, a light in
his eyes, and the shadow of a vital humor, a past
challenge, to his lips. He had lifted many toasts
in that vintage, his glass striking with a clear
vibration against other eagerly held glasses.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
More often than not they&mdash;Tirso, the guardsman
in statue, Remigio, Jaime, Andrés and himself&mdash;had
drunk to La Clavel. He drank to her, probably
the sole repository of her memory, her splendor,
on earth, now. &#8220;La Clavel,&#8221; he said her
name aloud. And then, &#8220;Andrés.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sharp gladness seized him that Andrés had,
almost at the last, heard his voice, his shouted
warning and apprehension and love. If liberty,
justice, were to come, one life, two, could make
no difference; a hundred years, a hundred hundred,
were small measures of time. And if all
were doomed, impossible, open to the knife of a
fateful Pilar, why, then, they had had their companionship,
their warmth, a period of unalloyed
fidelity to a need that broke ideals like reeds.
Perhaps what they had found was, after all,
within them, that for which they had swept the
sky.</p>
